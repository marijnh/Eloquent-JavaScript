# Eloquent JavaScript

These are the sources used to build the second edition of Eloquent
JavaScript.

The rewrite is a work in progress. Feedback welcome, in the form of
issues and pull requests. Chapter 0 to 6 are in a more or less stable
state. Don't waste too much time on detailed correction of anything
beyond that yet.

## Building

    npm install
    apt-get install asciidoc
    make html
    # and optionally (currently partly broken)
    apt-get install dblatex
    make tex

For OSX, you can use port or brew to install asciidoc package.
