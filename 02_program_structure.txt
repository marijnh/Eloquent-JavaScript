= Program Structure =

This is the point where we start to do things that can
actually be called _programming_. To learn to build a program, we'll
first discuss the structures that are used to build it.

== Expressions and statements ==

(((grammar)))(((JavaScript!syntax)))In the previous chapter, we made
some values and then applied operators to them to get new values.
Creating values like this is an essential part of every JavaScript
program, but it is only a part. A fragment of code that produces a
value is called an _((expression))_. Every value that is written
literally (such as `22` or `"psychoanalysis"`) is an expression. An
expression between parentheses is also an expression. And a binary
operator applied to two expressions, or a unary operator applied to
one, is also an expression.

This shows part of the beauty of a language-based interface.
Expressions can nest in a way very similar to the way sub-sentences in
human languages are nested—a sub-sentence can contain its own
sub-sentences, and so on. This allows us to combine expressions
together to express arbitrarily complex computations.

JavaScript actually has a few more ways of building expressions, which
will be explained later on.

(((statement)))(((semicolon)))(((program)))If an expression
corresponds to a sentence fragment, a _statement_, in JavaScript,
corresponds to a full sentence in a human language. A program is
simply a list of statement.

The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a semicolon after
it. This is a program:

[source,javascript]
-----
1;
!false;
-----

It is a useless program, though. An expression can be content to just
produce a value, which can then be used by the enclosing expression. A
statement stands on its own, and only amounts to something only if it
affects the world. It could print something to the screen—that
counts as changing the world—or it could change the internal state of
the program in a way that will affect the statements that come after
it. These changes are called _((side effect))s_. The statements in the
previous example just produce the values `1` and `true` and then
immediately throw them away again. This leaves no impression on the
world at all. When executing the program, nothing happens.

=== Semicolons ===

(((semicolon)))In some cases, JavaScript allows you to omit the
semicolon at the end of a statement. In other cases, it has to be
there, or strange things will happen. The rules for when it can be
safely omitted are somewhat complex and error-prone. In this book,
every statement that needs a semicolon will always be terminated by
one. I recommend you do the same in your own programs, at least until
you've learned more about subtleties involved in leaving out
semicolons.

== Variables ==

(((state)))(((side effect)))How does a program keep an internal state?
How does it remember things? We have seen how to produce new values
from old values, but this does not change the old values, and the new
value has to be immediately used or it will dissipate again. To catch
and hold values, JavaScript provides a thing called a _((variable))_.

[source,javascript]
-----
var caught = 5 * 5;
-----

(((var keyword)))And that gives us our second kind of statement. The
special word (_keyword_) `var` indicates that this sentence is going
to define a variable. It is followed by the name of the variable and,
if we want to immediately give it a value, by an `=` operator followed
by an expression.

So previous statement creates a variable called `caught` and uses it
to grab hold of the number that is produced by multiplying `5` by `5`.

After a variable has been defined, its name can be used as an
expression. The value of such an expression is the current value
that's being held by the variable. Here's an example:

[source,text/javascript]
-----
var ten = 10;
ten * ten;
// → 100
-----

(((variable,naming)))Variable names can be almost every word, but they
may not include spaces. Digits can also be part of variable
names—`catch22` is a valid name, for example—but the name must not
start with a digit. The characters `$` and `_` can be used in names as
if they were letters. So, for example, `$_$` is a correct variable
name.

When a variable points at a value, that does not mean it is tied to
that value forever. At any time, the `=` operator can be used on
existing variables to disconnect them from their current value and
have them point to a new one:

[source,text/javascript]
-----
var mood = "light";
mood;
// → "light"
mood = "dark";
mood;
// → "dark";
-----

(((variable!model of)))(((tentacle (variable analogy)))) You should
imagine variables as tentacles, rather than boxes. They do not
_contain_ values; they _grasp_ them—two variables can refer to the
same value. Only the values that the program still has a hold on can
be accessed by it. When you need to remember something, you grow a
tentacle to hold on to it or you reattach one of your existing
tentacles to it.

When you define a variable without giving it a value, the tentacle
conceptually ends in thin air—it has nothing to grasp. When you ask
for the value of an empty place, you get a the value `undefined`.

An example. To remember the amount of dollars that Luigi still owes
you, you create a variable for it. And then, when he pays back $35,
you give this variable a new value.

[source,text/javascript]
-----
var luigisDebt = 140;
luigisDebt = luigisDebt - 35;
luigisDebt;
// → 105
-----

== Keywords and reserved words ==

(((keyword)))(((reserved words)))(((variable!naming)))Note that names
that have a special meaning, such as `var`, may not be used as
variable names. These are called _keywords_. There are also a number
of (((reserved words)))words that are “reserved for use” in future
versions of JavaScript. These are also officially not allowed to be
used as variable names, though some browsers do allow them. The full
list is rather long:

[source,text/plain]
-----
break case catch continue debugger default delete
do else false finally for function if implements
in instanceof interface let new null package private
protected public return static switch throw true
try typeof var void while with yield this
-----

Don't worry about memorizing these, but remember that this might be
the problem when something does not work as expected.

== The environment ==

(((environment)))(((standard environment)))The collection of variables
and their values that exist at a given time is called the
_environment_. When a program starts up, this environment is not
empty. It will at least contain a number of variables that are part of
the language standard. And most of the time there will be an
additional set of variables that provide ways to interact with the
surrounding system. For example, in a browser, there'll be variables
that point at functionality that'll allow you to inspect and influence
the currently loaded website, and read mouse and keyboard input from
the person who is using the browser.

== Functions ==

(((Function type)))(((alert function)))(((message box)))A lot of the
values provided in the default environment have the type _function_. A
function is a piece of program wrapped in a value. Such a value can be
_applied_ in order to run the wrapped program. For example, in a
browser environment, the variable `alert` holds a function that shows
a little dialog box with a message. It is used like this:

[source,javascript]
-----
alert("Good morning!");
-----

image::../img/alert.png[alt="An alert dialog"]

indexsee:[application (of functions),function application]
indexsee:[invoking (of functions),function application]

(((function!application)))Executing the code in a function is called
_invoking_, _calling_, or _applying_ it. The notation for doing this
uses parentheses. Every expression that produces a function value can
be invoked by putting parentheses after it, though usually you will be
directly referring to the variable that holds the function. The values
between the parentheses are given to the program inside the function.
In the example, the `alert` function uses the string that we give it
as the text to show in the dialog box. Values given to functions are
called _((argument))s_ (or sometimes _((parameter))s_). `alert` needs
only one of them, but other functions might need a different number or
different types of arguments.

(((side effect)))(((return value)))(((max function)))Showing a dialog
box is a side effect. A lot of functions are useful because of the
side effects they produce. It is also possible for a function to
produce a value, in which case it does not need to have a side effect
to be useful. For example, there is a function `Math.max`, which takes
two numbers and gives back the greatest of the two:

[source,text/javascript]
-----
Math.max(2, 4);
// → 4
-----

(((min function)))When a function produces a value, it is said to
_return_ it. Because things that produce values are always expressions
in JavaScript, function calls can be used as part of bigger
expressions:

[source,text/javascript]
-----
Math.min(2, 4) + 100;
// → 102
-----

The next chapter explains how we can write our own functions.

=== prompt and confirm ===

(((confirm function)))The environment provided by browsers contains a
few more functions for popping up windows. You can ask the user an
“OK”/“Cancel” question using `confirm`. This returns a boolean: `true`
if the user clicks OK and `false` if the user clicks Cancel.

[source,javascript]
-----
confirm("Shall we, then?");
-----

image::../img/confirm.png[alt="An confirm dialog"]

(((prompt function)))(((text input)))`prompt` can be used to ask an
“open” question. The first argument is the question; the second one is
the text that the user starts with. A line of text can be typed into
the dialog window, and the function will return this as a string.

[source,javascript]
-----
prompt("Tell me everything you know.", "...");
-----

image::../img/prompt.png[alt="An prompt dialog"]

These two functions aren't used much in serious web programming,
mostly because you have no control over the way the resulting windows
look, but they are very useful for toy programs and experiments.

=== The console.log function ===

The `alert` function can be useful when trying out code, in order to
see what values it produces, but clicking away all those little
windows will get on your nerves. Most JavaScript systems (including
all modern Web browsers and node.js) provide a function `console.log`,
which prints out its arguments to _some_ text output device. In
browsers, the output lands in the JavaScript console, which is a part
of the user interface that is hidden by default, but can be found by
digging into the menu and finding an an item like “Web console” or
“Developer tools”, usually under a “Tools” or “Developer” sub-menu.

--html-only--
When running the examples, or your own code, on the pages of this
book, `console.log` output will be shown below the example, instead of
in the browser's JavaScript console.
--html-only--

The program below will log something like `the value of x is 30`.

[source,javascript]
-----
var x = 30;
console.log("the value of x is", x);
-----

Though I claimed before that variable names can not contain dots, both
`console.log` and `Math.max` clearly contain a dot. I haven't been
lying to you. It's just that these are not simple variables, but
actually expressions that retrieve, for `console.log`, the `log` field
from the value held by the `console` variable. We will find out what
this means in REF(data).

== Control flow ==

(((program)))(((control flow)))When your program contains more than
one statement, the statements are executed, predictably, from top to
bottom. As a basic example, this program has two statements. The first
one asks the user for a number, and the second, which is executed
afterwards, shows the square of that number:

[source,javascript]
-----
var theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number", ""));
alert("Your number is the square root of " + (theNumber * theNumber));
-----

(((Number function)))(((String function)))(((Boolean
function))))(((boolean conversion)))The function `Number` converts a
value to a number, which is we use because the result of `prompt` is a
string value, and we want a number. There are similar functions called
`String` and `Boolean` that convert values to those types.

Here is a rather boring schematic representation of straight control
flow:

image::../img/controlflow-straight.svg[alt="Trivial control flow"]

== Conditional execution ==

(((control flow)))(((conditional execution)))Executing statements in
straight-line order isn't the only option we have. A common
requirement is conditional execution, where we choose between two
different routes based on a boolean value.

image::../img/controlflow-if.svg[alt="Conditional control flow"]

Conditional execution is written with the `if` keyword in JavaScript.
In the simple case, we just want some code to be executed if, and only
if, a certain condition holds. For example, in the previous program,
we might want to show the square of the input only if the input is
actually a number.

[source,javascript]
-----
var theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number", ""));
if (!isNaN(theNumber))
  alert("Your number is the square root of " + (theNumber * theNumber));
-----

With this modification, if you enter “cheese”, or nothing at all, no
ouput will be shown.

The keyword (((if keyword)))`if` is used to execute or skip a
statement depending on the value of a boolean expression. It is always
followed by an expression between parentheses, and then a statement.

The `isNaN` function is a standard function that return `true` if the
argument it is given is `NaN`, and `Number` happens to return `NaN`
when you give it a string that doesn't represent a valid number. Thus,
the condition expresses “unless `theNumber` is not-a-number, do this.”

(((else keyword)))Often you have not only code that must be executed
when a certain condition holds but also code that handles the other
case, when the condition doesn't hold. This represents to the second
arrow in the diagram above. The `else` keyword can be used, together
with `if`, to create two separate, parallel paths that execution can
take:

[source,javascript]
-----
var theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number", ""));
if (!isNaN(theNumber))
  alert("Your number is the square root of " + (theNumber * theNumber));
else
  alert("I asked for a number. Why didn't you give me a number?");
-----

If we have more than two paths that we want to choose from, multiple
`if`/`else` pairs can be “chained” together. Here's an example:

[source,javascript]
-----
var num = prompt("Pick a number", "0");

if (num < 10)
  alert("Small");
else if (num < 100)
  alert("Medium");
else
  alert("Large");
-----

The program will first check whether `num` is less than 10. If it is,
it chooses that branch, shows `"Small"`, and is done. If it isn't, it
takes the `else` branch, which itself contains a second `if`. If the
second condition (`< 100`) holds, that means the number is between 10
and 100, and `"Medium"` is shown. If it doesn't, the second and last
`else` branch is chosen.

The arrow schema for this program looks something like this:

image::../img/controlflow-nested-if.svg[alt="Nested if control flow"]

== while and do loops ==

(((looping)))Consider a program that prints out all even numbers from
0 to 12. One way to write this is as follows:

[source,javascript]
-----
console.log(0);
console.log(2);
console.log(4);
console.log(6);
console.log(8);
console.log(10);
console.log(12);
-----

(((control flow)))That works, but the idea of writing a program is to
make something _less_ work, not more. If we needed all even numbers
less than 1,000, the previous would be unworkable. What we need is a
way to repeat some code—a _loop_.

image::../img/controlflow-loop.svg[alt="Loop control flow"]

Looping control flow allows us to go back to some point in the program
where we were before, and repeat it, in the context of our current
program state. If we combine this with a variable that counts, we can
do this:

[source,javascript]
-----
var number = 0;
while (number <= 12) {
  console.log(number);
  number = number + 2;
}
-----

(((while loop)))A statement starting with the word `while` creates a
loop. The word `while` is followed by an expression in parentheses and
then a statement, much like `if`. The loop acts by continuing to
execute the statement as long as the expression produces a value that
is `true`, when converted to boolean type.

((({} block)))(((statement)))(((block (of statements))))Because we
want to do _two_ things in the loop, printing out the current number,
and adding two to our variable, we wrap the two statements in braces
(`{` and `}`). Braces, for statements, are similar to what parentheses
do for expressions, they group them together, making them count as a
single statement.

(((variable)))(((state)))So the variable `number` demonstrates
the way a variable can track the progress of a program. Every time the
loop repeats, it is incremented by `2`. Then, at the beginning of
every repetition, it is compared with the number `12` to decide
whether the program has done all the work it intended to do.

(((exponentiation)))As an example that actually does something useful,
we can now write a program that calculates and shows the value of
2^10^ (2 to the 10th power). We use two variables: one to keep
track of our result and one to count how often we have multiplied this
result by 2. The loop tests whether the second variable has reached 10
yet and then updates both variables.

[source,text/javascript]
-----
var result = 1;
var counter = 0;
while (counter < 10) {
  result = result * 2;
  counter = counter + 1;
}
console.log(result);
// → 1024
-----

The counter could also start at `1` and check for `<= 10`, but, for
reasons that will become apparent later, it is a good idea to get used
to counting from 0.

(((do loop)))(((control flow)))A very similar control structure is the
`do` loop. It differs only on one point from a `while` loop: it will
always execute its body at once, and only then start testing whether
it should stop. To reflect this, the test is writen below the body of
the loop:

[source,javascript]
-----
do {
  var name = prompt("Who are you?");
} while (!name);
console.log(name);
-----

This will force you to enter a name, by asking again and again until
it gets something that is not an empty string. (Applying the `!`
operator will convert a value to boolean type before negating it, and
all strings except `""` convert to `true`.)

== Indenting Code ==

You will probably have noticed the spaces I put in front of some
statements. These are not required—the computer will accept the
program just fine without them. In fact, even the line breaks in
programs are optional. You could write them as a single long line if
you felt like it. The role of the ((indentation)) inside blocks is to
make the structure of the code stand out. Because new blocks can be
opened inside other blocks, it can become hard to see where one block
ends and another begins when looking at a complex piece of code. With
proper indentation, the visual shape of a program corresponds to the
shape of the blocks inside it. I like to use two spaces for every open
block, but tastes differ—some people use four spaces, and some people
use tab characters.

== for loops ==

Loops often follow the same pattern, also seen in the `while` examples
above. First, a “counter” variable is created. This variable tracks
the progress of the loop. Then, comes a `while` loop, whose test
expression usually checks whether the counter has reached some
boundary yet. At the end of the loop body, the counter is updated to
track progress.

Because this pattern is so common, JavaScript and similar languages
provide a slightly shorter and more comprehensive form:

[source,javascript]
-----
for (var number = 0; number <= 12; number = number + 2)
  console.log(number);
-----

(((for loop)))(((control flow)))(((state)))This program is exactly
equivalent to the earlier even-number-printing example. The only
change is that all the statements that are related to the “state” of
the loop are now on one line.

The parentheses after a `for` keyword are required to contain two
semicolons. The part before the first semicolon _initializes_ the
loop, usually by defining a variable. The second part is the
expression that _checks_ whether the loop must still continue. The
final part _updates_ the state of the loop after every iteration. In
most cases, this is shorter and clearer than a `while` construct.

Here is the code that computes 2^10^, using `for` instead of `while`:

[source,text/javascript]
-----
var result = 1;
for (var counter = 0; counter < 10; counter = counter + 1)
  result = result * 2;
console.log(result);
// → 1024
-----

(((indentation)))Note that even if no block is opened with a `{`, the
statement in the loop is still indented two spaces to make it clear
that it “belongs” to the line before it.

== Breaking Out of a Loop ==

(((looping!termination)))(((break keyword)))Having its condition
produce `false` is not the only way a loop can finish. There is a
special statement, `break`, that has the effect of immediately jumping
out of the enclosing loop.

This program finds the first number that is greater than or equal to
20, and divisible by 7:

[source,text/javascript]
-----
for (var current = 20; ; current++) {
  if (current % 7 == 0)
    break;
}
console.log(current);
// → 21
-----

(((remainder operation)))(((% operator)))The trick with the remainder
(`%`) operator is an easy way to test whether a number is divisible by
another number. If it is, the remainder of their division is zero.

The `for` construct in the example does not have a part that checks
for the end of the loop. This means that it is dependent on the
`break` statement inside it to ever stop.

If that `break` statement was missing, or you accidentally wrote a
condition that will always produce `true`, you get what is called an
_((infinite loop))_. A program running an infinite loop will never
finish running, which is usually a bad thing.

--html-only--
If you create an infinite loop in one of the examples on these pages,
you'll have to close the tab that you're working in, or on some
browsers close your whole browser, to recover.
--html-only--

== Updating variables succinctly ==

(((assignment)))(((+= operator)))(((-= operator)))(((/=
operator)))(((*= operator)))(((state)))A program, especially when
looping, often needs to “update” a variable with a value that is based
on its previous value, as in `counter = counter + 1`. JavaScript
provides a shortcut for this: `counter += 1`. This also works for many
other operators, as in `result *= 2` to double the value of `result`
or as in `counter -= 1` to count downward.

(((++ operator)))(((-- operator)))For `counter += 1` and `counter -=
1`, there are even shorter versions: `counter++` and `counter--`.

Which allows us to shorten our example a little more:

[source,javascript]
-----
for (var number = 0; number <= 12; number += 2)
  console.log(number);
-----

== Dispatching on a Value with switch ==

It is common for code to look like this:

[source,javascript]
-----
if (variable == "value1") action1();
else if (variable == "value2") action2();
else if (variable == "value3") action3();
else defaultAction();
-----

(((dispatch)))(((switch keyword)))There is a construct called `switch`
that is intended to solve such a “dispatch” in a more direct way.
Unfortunately, the syntax JavaScript uses for this (which it inherited
from the C and Java line of programming languages) is somewhat
awkward—often a chain of `if` statements still looks better. Here
is an example:

[source,javascript]
-----
switch(prompt("What is the weather like?")) {
  case "rainy":
    console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella.");
    break;
  case "sunny":
    console.log("Dress lightly.");
  case "cloudy":
    console.log("Go outside.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown weather type!");
    break;
}
-----

(((case keyword)))(((default keyword)))Inside the block opened by
`switch`, you may put any number of `case` labels. The program will
jump to the label that corresponds to the value that `switch` was
given, or to `default` if no matching value is found. Then it start
executing statements there, and _continues_ past other labels, until
it reaches a `break` statement. In some cases, such as the `"sunny"`
case in the example, this can be used to share some code between cases
(it recommends going outside for both sunny and cloudy weather). But
beware, it is very easy to forget such a `break`, which will cause the
program to execute code you do not want executed.

== Capitalization ==

Variable names may not contain spaces, yet it is often helpful to use
multiple words to clearly describe what the variable represents. Your
choices for writing a variable name with several words in it are
pretty much these: `fuzzylittleturtle`, `fuzzy_little_turtle`,
`FuzzyLittleTurtle`, and `fuzzyLittleTurtle`.

(((capitalization)))The first example is hard to read. Personally, I
like using underscores, though it is a little painful to type.
However, the standard JavaScript functions, and most JavaScript
programmers, follow the last example—they capitalize every word except
the first. It is not hard to get used to little things like that, and
code with mixed naming styles can be jarring to read, so we will just
follow this convention.

(((Number function)))(((constructor)))In a few cases, such as the
`Number` function, the first letter of a variable is also capitalized.
This was done to mark this function as a constructor. What a
constructor is will become clear in REF(oo). For now, the important
thing is not to be bothered by this apparent lack of consistency.

== Comments ==

Often, raw code does not convey all the information you want a program
to convey to human readers, or it conveys it in such a cryptic way
that you're worried that people won't understand it. At other times,
you're just feeling poetic and want to mark down some thoughts as part
of your program. This is what _((comment))s_ are is for.

A comment is a piece of text that is part of a program, but completely
ignored by the computer. JavaScript has two ways of writing comments.
To write a single line comment, you can use two slash characters
(`//`) and then the comment text after it.

[source,javascript]
----
var accountBalance = calculateBalance(account);
// It's a green hollow where a river sings
accountBalance.adjust() // Madly catching white tatters in the grass.
var report = new Report(); // Where the sun on the proud mountain rings:
addToReport(accountBalance, report);
// It's a little valley, foaming like light in a glass.
----

A `//` comment only goes to the end of the line. A section of text
between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored, regardless of whether it
contains line breaks. This is often useful for adding blocks of
information about a file or a chunk of program.

[source,javascript]
----
/*
  I first found this number scrawled on the back of one of my
  notebooks a few years ago. Since then, it has occasionally dropped
  by, showing up in phone numbers and the serial numbers of producs
  that I bought. It obviously likes me, so I've decided to keep it.
*/
var theNumber = 11213;
----

== Summary ==

You now know that a program is built out of statements, which
themselves sometimes contain more statements. Statements tend to
contain expressions, which themselves can be built out of smaller
expressions.

Putting statements under each other gives you a program that is
executed top-to-bottom. You can introduce disturbances in the flow of
control by using conditional (`if`, `else`, and `switch`) and looping
(`while`, `do`, and `for`) statements.

Functions are special values that encapsulate a piece of program. You
can invoke them by writing `functionName(argument1, argument2)`, which
is an expression that may produce a value.

== Exercises ==

If you are unsure how to try out your solutions to exercises, refer
back to the end of REF(intro).

Each exercise starts with a problem description above the ruler. Try
to read that, and solve the exercise. If you run into problems, you
can consider reading the hints below the ruler. Full solutions to the
exercises are not included in this book, but can be found online, at
REF(solutions). If you want to learn something, I recommend only
looking at these after you've solved the exercise, or at least
attacked it long and hard enough to have provoked a slight headache.

=== Looping a triangle ===

Write a program that makes seven calls to `console.log` to output the
following triangle:

....
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
....

''''

You can start with a program that simply prints out the numbers 1 to
7, which you can derive by making a few modifications to the
even-number-printing example given earlier in the chapter, when the
`for` loop was introduced.

Now consider the equivalence between numbers and strings of hash
characters. You can go from 1 to 2 by adding 1 (`+= 1`). You can go
from `"#"` to `"##"` by adding a character (`+= "#"`). Thus, your
solution can closely follow the number-printing program.

=== Number grid ===

Write a program that creates a string that represents a 5×5 grid, by
using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the
grid there is a digit character that represents the _x_ (horizontal)
coordinate of that point minus the _y_ (vertical) coordinate (where
0,0 is the top-left corner).

The output should look like this:

....
01234
12343
23432
34321
43210
....

When it works, define a variable `size = 5`, and change the program so
that it works for any `size` between 1 and 10, outputting a grid of
the given width and height.

The string can be built by starting with an empty one (`""`) and
repeatedly adding characters. A newline character is written `"\n"`.
When appending digits, you can explicitly convert number to strings
using the `String` function, or simply rely on the type conversion
behavior of the `+` operator (when one of the values given is a
string, the result will be a string).

Use `console.log` to inspect the output of your program.

To do something two dimensional, you will need a loop inside of a
loop. Put braces around the bodies of both loops to make it easy to
see where they start and end. Try to properly indent these bodies. The
order of the loops must follow the order in which we build up the
string (line by line, left to right, top to bottom). So the outer loop
handles the lines (_y_ coordinate) and the inner loop handles the
characters on a line (_x_ coordinate). You'll need two variables to
track your progress, and to compute the digits at each position. You
might as well name them `x` and `y`.

Terminating a line by adding a newline character happens after the
line has been built up, so after the inner loop, inside of the outer
loop.

=== FizzBuzz ===

Write a program that prints (using `console.log`) all the numbers from
1 to 100, except that, for numbers that are divisible by 3, it prints
`"Fizz"` instead of the number, and for numbers that are divisible by
5 (and not 3), it prints `"Buzz"` instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print `"FizzBuzz"`
for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.

(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed
out large swaths of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, you're
supposedly already better than a lot of people who are seriously
applying for programmer jobs.)

Going over the numbers is clearly a looping job. And selecting what to
print is a matter of conditional execution. Remember the trick of
using the remainder (`%`) operator for checking whether a number is
divisible by another number (has a remainder of zero).

Because, in the first version, there are three possible outcomes for
every number, you'll have to create an `if`/`else if`/`else` chain.

The second version of the program can be solved in a very
straightforward way (simply add another “branch” that precisely tests
the given condition), or in a clever way (build up a string containing
the word or word to output, and print either this word or the number
if there is no word, potentially by making elegant use of the `||`
operator).
