= Practical: Electronic Life =

In the practical chapters of this book, I stop pummeling you with new
theory for a brief moment, and instead work through a program. Theory
is indispensable, but reading and understanding programs, as I claimed
in the introduction, is the best way to learn programming.

The example project for this chapter is to build a virtual ecosystem,
a little world with creatures moving around in it, in which the
animals are autonomous programs struggling for survival.

== Definition ==

In order to make this task manageable, we radically simplify the
concept of a “world”. Namely, we understand it to mean a
two-dimensional grid with each entity taking up a full square of the
grid. Each “turn”, all the animals in the world get a chance to take
some action.

(((discretization)))(((simulation))) Thus, we chop both time and space
into units with a fixed size—squares for space and turns for time.
This tends to make things easier to model. Of course, it has the
drawback of being crude and inaccurate. But this simulation is
intended to be amusing, not accurate, so we can freely cut such
corners.

A world can be defined with a “plan,” which is an array of strings
that lay out the world's grid, using one character per square, and a
legend, which is an object that tells us, for each character, what it
means.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
var plan =
  ["############################",
   "#      #    #      o      ##",
   "#                          #",
   "#          #####           #",
   "##         #   #    ##     #",
   "###           ##     #     #",
   "#           ###      #     #",
   "#   ####                   #",
   "#   ##       o             #",
   "# o  #         o       ### #",
   "#    #                     #",
   "############################"];
----

We could have used a single string, but the array structure nicely
reflects the two-dimensional structure of the data.

The ‘#’ characters in this plan represent walls (and rocks), and the
‘o’ characters represent critters, and the spaces are, as you might
have guessed, empty space.

(((toString method)))Such a plan array can be used to create a world
object. This object keeps track of the shape and content of the world
and lets the critters inside move. It has a method `toString`, which
converts the world back to a string similar to the plan it was based
on, so that you can see what is going on inside of it. And a method
`turn`, which lets all the critters in it take one turn, and updates
the world to reflect their actions.

== Representing space ==

The grid that models the world has a fixed width and height
(corresponding to the size of the map that the world is based on).
Squares are identified by their x- and y-coordinates. We use a very
simple type, `Point` (as seen in the exercises for the previous
chapter) to represent such coordinate pairs.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function Point(x, y) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}
Point.prototype.plus = function(other) {
  return new Point(this.x + other.x, this.y + other.y);
};
----

Next, we'll want an object type that models the grid itself. A grid is
part of a world, but we do want to make it a separate object (which
will be _part_ of a world object) in order to help keep the world
object simple. The world will concern itself with world-related
things, the grid with grid-related things.

(((array)))(((data structure)))To store the values on the grid, there
are several options. We can use an array of row arrays and use two
property accesses to get to a specific point, like this:

[source,javascript]
----
var grid = [["0,0", "1,0", "2,0"],
            ["0,1", "1,1", "2,1"]];
console.log(grid[1][2]);
// → 2,1
----

Or, we can use a single array, with size width × height, and decide
that the element at x,y is found at position x + y × width in the
array.

[source,javascript]
----
var grid = ["0,0", "1,0", "2,0",
            "0,1", "1,1", "2,1"];
console.log(grid[2 + 1 * 3]);
// → 2,1
----

(((Array type)))Since the actual access to this array is wrapped in
methods on the grid object type, it doesn't matter to outside code
which approach we take. I chose the second representation, because it
makes it much easier to initialize the array. When calling the `Array`
constructor with a single number as argument, that produces a new
array of the given length, filled with `undefined` values.

This code defines the `Grid` object, with some basic methods:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function Grid(width, height) {
  this.space = new Array(width * height);
  this.width = width;
  this.height = height;
}
Grid.prototype.isInside = function(point) {
  return point.x >= 0 && point.x < this.width &&
         point.y >= 0 && point.y < this.height;
};
Grid.prototype.get = function(point) {
  return this.space[point.x + this.width * point.y];
};
Grid.prototype.set = function(point, value) {
  this.space[point.x + this.width * point.y] = value;
};
----

And a trivial test:

[source,javascript]
----
var grid = new Grid(5, 5);
console.log(grid.get(new Point(1, 1)));
// → undefined
grid.set(new Point(1, 1), "X");
console.log(grid.get(new Point(1, 1)));
// → X
----

== A critter's programming interface ==

(((interface)))Before we can start to write a `World` constructor, we
will have to get a bit more specific about these “critter objects”
that will be living inside it. I mentioned that the world will ask the
critters what action they want to take. This works as follows: Each
critter object has an `act` method that, when called, returns an
_action_. An action is an object with a `type` property, which names
the type of action the critter wants to take, for example `"move"`.
The action may also contain extra information, such as the direction
the critter wants to move in.

Critters are terribly myopic, and thus they can only see the squares
directly around them on the grid. But these they can use to base their
action on. When the `act` method is called, it is given a “view”
object that allows the critter to inspect its surroundings. We name
each of the eight nearby squares (cardinal plus diagonal) with its
compass name: `"n"` for North, `"ne"` for North-East, and so on. We'll
use this object to map from direction names to coordinate offsets:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
var directions = {
  "n":  new Point( 0, -1),
  "ne": new Point( 1, -1),
  "e":  new Point( 1,  0),
  "se": new Point( 1,  1),
  "s":  new Point( 0,  1),
  "sw": new Point(-1,  1),
  "w":  new Point(-1,  0),
  "nw": new Point(-1, -1)
};
----

The view objects passed to the `act` method have a method `look`,
which takes a direction and returns a character, for example `"#"`
when there is a wall in that direction, or `" "` (space) when there is
nothing there. They also provide the convenient methods `find` and
`findAll`. Both take a map character as argument. The first tries to
find a direction in which such a character is found, and returns it,
or `null` if no such element is next to the critter. The second
returns an array containing all directions that hold the character.
For example, a creature sitting left of a wall will get `["ne", "e",
"se"]` when calling `findAll` on its view object with the `"#"`
character as argument.

We can make a simple, stupid critter that just bounces around,
following its nose until it hits an obstacle, and then moving off into
a random open direction, like this:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function randomElement(array) {
  return array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
}

function BouncingCritter() {
  this.direction = randomElement(Object.keys(directions)); 
};

BouncingCritter.prototype.act = function(view) {
  if (view.look(this.direction) != " ")
    this.direction = view.find(" ") || "s";
  return {type: "move", direction: this.direction};
};
----

The “++|| s++” part is there to prevent `this.direction` from getting
the value null when the critter is somehow trapped with no empty space
around it (for example when crowded in a corner by other critters).

The `randomElement` function simply picks a random element from an
array, using `Math.random` plus some arithmetic to get a random index.
We'll use that again later (randomness is useful for simulations). We
saw `Object.keys` in the previous chapter. It returns an array
containing all the property names in the given object. In this case,
all the direction names.

== The world object ==

Now we can start on the `World` object type. Here is its constructor,
which takes a plan (an array of strings) and a legend as arguments and
initializes the world's grid:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function elementFromChar(legend, ch) {
  if (ch == " ")
    return null;
  var element = new legend[ch]();
  element.originChar = ch;
  return element;
}

function World(map, legend) {
  var grid = new Grid(map[0].length, map.length);
  this.grid = grid;
  this.legend = legend;

  map.forEach(function(line, y) {
    for (var x = 0; x < line.length; x++)
      grid.set(new Point(x, y),
               elementFromChar(legend, line[x]));
  });
}
----

A legend object contains a constructor for each character that occurs
in the map, except for space, which always refers to `null`, the value
used to represent empty space. In `elementFromChar`, after creating an
instance of the right type by looking up this constructor and applying
`new` to it, we add an `originChar` property to it to make it easy to
find out what character it was created from.

(((toString method)))We need to know that when implementing the
`toString` method. This method builds up a map-like string from the
world's current state, by doing a double loop over all the squares on
the grid.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function charFromElement(element) {
  if (element == null)
    return " ";
  else
    return element.originChar;
}

World.prototype.toString = function() {
  var output = "";
  for (var y = 0; y < this.grid.height; y++) {
    for (var x = 0; x < this.grid.width; x++) {
      var element = this.grid.get(new Point(x, y));
      output += charFromElement(element);
    }
    output += "\n";
  }
  return output;
};
----

When we try this out by creating a new world based on the plan shown
above, and then calling `toString` on it, we get a string very similar
to the plan you put in.

// include_code strip_log
// test: trim

[source,javascript]
----
function Wall() {}

var world = new World(plan,
                      {"#": Wall,
                       "o": BouncingCritter});
console.log(world.toString());
// → ############################
//   #      #    #      o      ##
//   #                          #
//   #          #####           #
//   ##         #   #    ##     #
//   ###           ##     #     #
//   #           ###      #     #
//   #   ####                   #
//   #   ##       o             #
//   # o  #         o       ### #
//   #    #                     #
//   ############################
----

A wall is a very simple object—it is only used for taking up space,
and has no `act` method.

== this and its scope ==

(((this variable)))(((variable,scope)))(((self variable)))
The `World` constructor contains a call to `forEach`. One interesting
thing to note is that, inside of the function passed to `forEach`
there, we no longer have access to the `this` from the outer function.
Each function binds its own `this`. It is bound to the global scope
object when no actual method call is made. Thus, saying `this.grid` in
the loop function wouldn't work, and a local `grid` variable had to be
used to get access to the grid. This is a bit of a design blunder in the
JavaScript language (the next version of the language provides a
solution for this problem).

There are workarounds for this. A common pattern is to say `var self =
this`, and from then on, refer to `self`, which is a normal variable,
and thus visible from inner functions.

Another solution is to use the `bind` method, which allows us to
provide an explicit `this` object to bind to.

[source,javascript]
----
var test = {
  prop: 10,
  method: function(array) {
    array.forEach(function(elt) {
      console.log(this.prop + elt);
    }.bind(this));
  }
};
test.method([5]);
// → 15
----

The function passed to `forEach` will now be the result of the `bind`
call, and thus have its `this` bound to the first argument given to
`bind`—the outer function's `this` value (which will hold the `test`
object in this example).

Most of the standard array higher-order methods, such as `forEach` and
`map`, take an optional second argument that can also be used for this
purpose. The value you pass there will be used as the `this` of the
calls to the given function, so you could also express the example
above in a slightly simpler way:

[source,javascript]
----
var test = {
  prop: 10,
  method: function(array) {
    array.forEach(function(elt) {
      console.log(this.prop + elt);
    }, this); // ← no bind
  }
};
test.method([5]);
// → 15
----

This only works for higher-order functions that support this feature,
so you'll often need to fall back to one of the other approaches.

This `forEach` method for our `Grid` type, which calls a given
function for each element in the grid that isn't null or undefined,
passing it the value and the point, demonstrates how to support such a
“context” parameter to a higher-order function by using the given
function's `call` method.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
Grid.prototype.forEach = function(f, context) {
  for (var y = 0; y < this.height; y++) {
    for (var x = 0; x < this.width; x++) {
      var value = this.space[x + y * this.width];
      if (value != null)
        f.call(context, value, new Point(x, y));
    }
  }
};
----

== Animating life ==

(((simulation)))The next goal is to write a method `turn` for the
world object, that gives the critters inside of it a chance to act. It
will go over the whole grid, square by square, looking for objects
with an `act` method. When it finds one, it calls that method to get
an action object, and carries out the resulting action if it makes
sense. For now, only `"move"` actions are understood.

There is one potential problem with this approach. Can you spot it? If
we let critters move as we come across them, they may move to a square
that we haven't looked at yet, and we'll allow them to move _again_
when we reach that square. Thus, we have to keep an array of critters
that already had their turn, and ignore those when we see them again.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
World.prototype.turn = function() {
  var acted = [];
  this.grid.forEach(function(critter, point) {
    if (critter.act && acted.indexOf(critter) == -1) {
      acted.push(critter);
      this.letAct(critter, point);
    }
  }, this);
};
----

We use the second parameter to the grid's `forEach` method to be able
to access the correct `this` inside of the inner function. The
`letAct` method, then, contains the actual logic that allows the
critters to move.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
World.prototype.letAct = function(critter, point) {
  var action = critter.act(new View(this, point));
  if (action && action.type == "move") {
    var dest = this.checkDestination(action, point);
    if (dest && this.grid.get(dest) == null) {
      this.grid.set(point, null);
      this.grid.set(dest, critter);
    }
  }
};

World.prototype.checkDestination = function(action, point) {
  if (directions.hasOwnProperty(action.direction)) {
    var dest = point.plus(directions[action.direction]);
    if (this.grid.isInside(dest))
      return dest;
  }
};
----

First, we simply ask the critter to act, passing it a view object
that knows about the world and the critter's current position in that
world (we'll define `View` in a moment). This returns an action of
some kind.

If the action's `type` is not `"move"`, it is ignored. If it _is_
`"move"`, and it has a `direction` property that refers to a valid
direction, _and_ the square in that direction is empty (null), we set
the square where the critter used to be to hold null, and store the
critter in the destination square.

(((interface)))(((private property)))These two methods are not part of
the external interface of a `World` object. They are internal details.
Some languages provide ways to explicitly declare certain methods and
properties “private” and signal an error when you try to use them from
outside the object. JavaScript does not, so you will have to rely on
some other form of communication to describe what is part of an
object's interface. Sometimes it can be useful to use a naming scheme
to distinguish between external and internal properties, for example
by prefixing all internal ones with an underscore (‘_’). This will
make accidental uses of properties that are not part of an object's
interface easier to spot.

(((defensive programming)))Note that `letAct` takes care to ignore
nonsense input—it doesn't assume that the action's `direction`
property is valid, or that the `type` property makes sense. This kind
of “defensive” programming makes sense in some situations. The main
reason for doing it is to validate inputs coming from sources we do
not control (such as user or file input), but it can also be useful to
isolate subsystems from each other. In this case, the idea is that the
critters themselves can be programmed sloppily (they don't have to
verify if their intended actions make sense, they can just request an
action and the world will figure out whether to allow it), which can
be convenient.

The one missing part, the `View` type, looks like this:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function View(world, point) {
  this.world = world;
  this.point = point;
}
View.prototype.look = function(dir) {
  var target = this.point.plus(directions[dir]);
  if (this.world.grid.isInside(target))
    return charFromElement(this.world.grid.get(target));
  else
    return "#";
};
View.prototype.findAll = function(ch) {
  var found = [];
  for (var dir in directions)
    if (this.look(dir) == ch)
      found.push(dir);
  return found;
};
View.prototype.find = function(ch) {
  var found = this.findAll(ch);
  if (found.length == 0) return null;
  return randomElement(found);
};
----

The `look` method figures out the coordinates that we are trying to
look at, and, if that is inside of the grid, finds the character that
corresponds to the element that sits there. When outside of the grid,
it simply pretends that there is a wall there, so that if you define a
world that isn't walled in, the critters still won't be tempted to try
and walk off the edges.

== It moves ==

We instantiated a world object before. Now that we've added all the
necessary methods, it should be possible to actually make it move.

[source,javascript]
----
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  world.turn();
  console.log(world.toString());
}
// → … five turns of moving critters
----

The first two maps that are displayed will look something like this
(depending on the random direction the critters picked):

Just logging out many copies of the map makes for a rather unpleasant
way to observe a world though. That is why the sandbox provides a
function `animateWorld` that will run a world as an on-screen
animation, moving three turns per second, until you hit the stop
button.

The way `animateWorld` is actually built will remain a mystery for
now, but after you've read the later chapters of this book, which
discuss JavaScript integration in web browsers, it won't look so
magical anymore.

== More life forms ==

So, we have a world in which something is happening. The dramatic
highlight so far, if you watch the world for a bit, is two bouncing
critters bouncing off each other. Let's introduce a second kind of
critter. Can you think of another interesting form of behavior, in the
limited context we have so far?

One I came up with is a critter that follows walls. It (conceptually)
keeps its left hand (paw, tentacle, whatever) to the wall, and keeps
moving along that wall. This was actually more difficult to express
than I intentionally expected, so be prepared to do a few double takes
on the following code.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
var directionNames = Object.keys(directions);
function dirPlus(dir, n) {
  var index = directionNames.indexOf(dir);
  return directionNames[(index + n + 8) % 8];
}

function WallFollower() {
  this.dir = "s";
}

WallFollower.prototype.act = function(view) {
  var start = this.dir;
  if (view.look(dirPlus(this.dir, -3)) != " ")
    start = this.dir = dirPlus(this.dir, -2);
  while (view.look(this.dir) != " ") {
    this.dir = dirPlus(this.dir, 1);
    if (this.dir == start) break;
  }
  return {type: "move", direction: this.dir};
};
----

First, we need to be able to “compute” with directions. Since they are
modeled by a set of strings, we need to define our own operation
(`dirPlus`) to calculate relative directions. So `dirPlus("n", 1)`
means one 45-degree turn clockwise from North, so `"ne"`. Similarly,
`dirPlus("s", -2)` means 90 degrees counterclockwise from South, which
is East.

The function first looks up the index of the given direction in the
`directionNames` array, then offsets it, takes the remainder of the
result and 8, and then fetches the corresponding name from the array
again. The extra “+++ 8++” is there because the ‘%’ operator, when
given a negative number on the left hand side, will return a negative
result. So we add another eight to make sure the sum is positive,
under the requirement that the `n` argument is never less than -8.

The `act` method, in the simple case, only has to do the following: It
starts “scanning” the critter's surroundings starting from its
left-hand side, and going clockwise (towards the right) until it finds
an empty square. It then moves in the direction of that empty square.

What complicates things is that a critter may end up, as its start
position or as a result of walking around another critter, in the
middle of empty space. If we apply the algorithm I just described in
empty space, the poor thing will just keep on turning left at every
step, running in circles.

So there is an extra check (the `if` statement) that makes it only
start scanning to its left when it looks like it just passed some kind
of obstacle (the space behind-and-to-the-left of the critter is not
empty). Otherwise, it start scanning directly in front of it, so that
it'll walk straight when in empty space.

And finally, there's a test comparing `this.dir` to `start` after
every turn of the loop, to make sure that the loop won't run forever
when the critter is walled in or crowded in by other critters, and
can't find empty space.

== A more lifelike simulation ==

add the concepts of food and reproduction. Each living thing in the
world gets a new property, `energy`, which is reduced by performing
actions and increased by eating things. When it has enough energy, a
critter can reproduce, generating a new critter of the same kind. To
keep things reasonably simple, the critters in our world reproduce
asexually, all by themselves.

(((entropy)))If there are only normal critters, wasting energy by
moving around and eating each other, a world will soon succumb to the
forces of entropy, run out of energy, and become a lifeless wasteland.
To prevent this from happening (too quickly, at least), we add plants
to the world. Plants do not move. They just use photosynthesis to grow
(increase their energy), and reproduce.

To make this work, we'll need a world with a different `letAct`
method. We could just replace the method of the `World` prototype, but
we have become very attached to our simulation with the wall-following
critters, and would hate to break that old world.

(((inheritance)))A solution is to use inheritance. We create a new
constructor, `LifeLikeWorld`, whose prototype is based on the `World`
prototype, but which overrides the `letAct` method.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function LifeLikeWorld(map, legend) {
  World.call(this, map, legend);
}
LifeLikeWorld.prototype = Object.create(World.prototype);

var actionTypes = Object.create(null);

LifeLikeWorld.prototype.letAct = function(critter, point) {
  var action = critter.act(new View(this, point));
  var handled = action &&
    action.type in actionTypes &&
    actionTypes[action.type].call(this, critter,
                                  point, action);
  if (!handled) {
    critter.energy -= 0.2;
    if (critter.energy <= 0)
      this.grid.set(point, null);
  }
};
----

The pattern of deriving a type from another type was explained in the
previous chapter. This `letAct` method delegates the work of actually
performing an action to various functions stored in the `actionTypes`
object, under property names corresponding to the action's name. We
will define these functions in a moment. It first checks whether an
action was returned at all, then whether a handler function for this
type of action exists, and finally, whether than handler returns true,
indicating that it successfully handled the action. Note the use of
`call` to give the handler access to the world, though its `this`
binding.

When handling didn't work, for whatever reason, the default action is
performed, which means the creature simply waits. One fifth point of
energy is removed from it, and if that drops its energy level to zero
or below, the creature dies, and is removed from the grid.

== Action handlers ==

The simplest action a creature can perform is `"grow"`, which is used
by plants. When an action object like `{type: "grow"}` is returned,
the following handler method will be called:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
actionTypes.grow = function(critter) {
  critter.energy += 0.5;
  return true;
};
----

Growing always succeeds, and adds half a point to the plant's energy
level.

Moving is more involved:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
actionTypes.move = function(critter, point, action) {
  var dest = this.checkDestination(action, point);
  if (dest == null || critter.energy <= 1 ||
      this.grid.get(dest) != null)
    return false;
  critter.energy -= 1;
  this.grid.set(point, null);
  this.grid.set(dest, critter);
  return true;
};
----

This one first checks whether the action provides a valid destination
(using the `direction` property from the action) through the
`checkDestination` method defined earlier, whether the critter has
the energy required—moving costs one unit of energy—and whether the
destination square is actually empty. If any of those fail, it returns
false to tell `letAct` that no action was taken. Otherwise, it moves
the critter, and subtracts the energy cost.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
actionTypes.eat = function(critter, point, action) {
  var dest = this.checkDestination(action, point);
  var atDest = dest != null && this.grid.get(dest);
  if (atDest == null || atDest.energy == null)
    return false;
  critter.energy += atDest.energy;
  this.grid.set(dest, null);
  return true;
};
----

Eating another critter also involves providing a valid destination
square. This time, the destination must not be empty, but must contain
a critter that has energy (i.e. not a wall—walls are not edible). If
that succeeds, the energy from the eaten thing is transferred to the
current critter, and the eaten thing is removed from the grid.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
actionTypes.reproduce = function(critter, point, action) {
  var baby = elementFromChar(this.legend,
                             critter.originChar);
  var dest = this.checkDestination(action, point);
  if (dest == null || critter.energy <= 2 * baby.energy ||
      this.grid.get(dest) != null)
    return false;
  critter.energy -= baby.energy * 2;
  this.grid.set(dest, baby);
  return true;
};
----

Reproducing costs twice the energy level of the newborn critter. So we
first create a (hypothetical) baby using `elementFromChar` on the
critter's own origin character. Once we have a baby, we know its
energy level and can test whether the parent has enough energy to
successfully put it into the world. We also require a valid (and
empty) destination again.

If everything is okay, the baby is put onto the grid (it is now no
longer hypothetical) and the energy is spent.

== Populating the new world ==

We now have the “framework” needed to simulate these lifelike
creatures. We could put the critters from the old world into it, but
they would just die, since they don't have an energy attribute. So let
us make new ones. First we'll write a plant, which is a rather simple
life form.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function Plant() {
  this.energy = 3 + Math.random() * 4;
}
Plant.prototype.act = function(context) {
  if (this.energy > 15) {
    var space = context.find(" ");
    if (space != null)
      return {type: "reproduce", direction: space};
  }
  if (this.energy < 20)
    return {type: "grow"};
}
----

Plants start with an energy level between 3 and 7, randomized so that
they don't all reproduce in the same turn. When they reach 15 energy
points and there is empty space nearby, they reproduce into that empty
space. Otherwise, they simply grow until they reach energy level 20.

Next, a plant eater.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function PlantEater() {
  this.energy = 20;
}
PlantEater.prototype.act = function(context) {
  var space = context.find(" ");
  if (this.energy > 60 && space != null)
    return {type: "reproduce", direction: space};
  var plant = context.find("*");
  if (plant != null)
    return {type: "eat", direction: plant};
  if (space)
    return {type: "move", direction: space};
};
----

We'll use the ‘*’ character for plants, so that is what this creature
looks for when it searches for food.

== Bringing it to life ==

And that gives us enough elements to try our new world. Imagine a
grassy valley with a herd of herbivores in it, some boulders, and lush
plant life everywhere. That's what this code is trying to express:

[source,javascript]
----
var valley = new LifeLikeWorld(
  ["############################",
   "#####                 ######",
   "##   ***                **##",
   "#   *##**         **  O  *##",
   "#    ***     O    ##**    *#",
   "#       O         ##***    #",
   "#                 ##**     #",
   "#   O       #*             #",
   "#*          #**       O    #",
   "#***        ##**    O    **#",
   "##****     ###***       *###",
   "############################"],
  {"#": Wall,
   "O": PlantEater,
   "*": Plant}
);
----

Let us see what happens if we run that. !!tex These snapshots

Most of the time, the lichen plants multiply and expand quite quickly,
but then the abundance of food causes a population explosion of the
herbivores, who proceed to wipe out all or nearly all of the plants,
resulting in a mass starvation of the critters. Sometimes, the
ecosystem recovers and another cycle starts. At other times, one of
the species dies out. If it's the herbivores, the whole space will
fill with plants. If it's the plants, the last plant eaters starve,
and the valley becomes a desolate wasteland. Ah, tragedies of nature.

== Exercises ==

=== Artificial stupidity ===

Having the inhabitants of our world go extinct after a few minutes is
kind of depressing. To deal with this, we could try to create a
smarter plant eater.

Observing this ecosystem in action, there are several problems that I
notice. Firstly, the herbivores are terribly greedy, stuffing
themselves with any plant they see, and thus wiping out plant life in
any area where they are plentiful. Secondly, their randomized movement
(the `view.find` method returns a random direction when multiple
directions are possible) causes them to stumble around ineffectively,
often causing them to starve when there are no plans in their
immediate vicinity. And finally, they breed very fast, which makes the
cycling between abundance and famine especially intense.

Write a new critter type that tries to address one or more of these
points, and substitute it for the old `PlantEater` type in the valley
world. See how it fares. Tweak it some more if necessary.

!!solution!!

The greediness problem can be attacked in several ways. The critters
could stop eating when they reach a certain energy level. Or only eat
every N turns (by keeping a counter of the turns since their last meal
in a property on the creature object). Or, to make sure plants never
go entirely extinct, they could refuse to eat a plant unless they see
at least one other plant nearby (using the `findAll` method on the
view). A combination of these (or some entirely different strategy)
might also work.

Making the critters move more effectively could be done by stealing
the movement strategy from one of the critters we had in our old,
energyless world. Both the bouncing behavior (walk straight until you
hit an obstacle, then turn randomly) and the wall-following behavior
showed a much wider range of movement than the completely random
staggering.

Making creatures breed more slowly is trivial. Just increase the
minimum energy level at which they reproduce. Of course, making the
ecosystem more stable also makes it more boring. A handful of fat,
immobile critters forever munching on a sea of plants, never
reproducing, makes for a very stable ecosystem. But no one wants to
see that.

!!solution!!

=== Predators ===

A serious ecosystem has a food chain longer than a single link. Write
another critter that survives by eating the herbivore critter. You'll
notice that stability is even harder to obtain when there are cycles
going on on multiple levels. Try to find a strategy to make the
ecosystem run smoothly for at least a little while.

One thing that definitely helps is to make the world bigger, so that
local population booms or busts are less likely to wipe out a species
entirely, and a relatively large prey population is needed to sustain
a small predator population.

   "####################################################"],
  {"#": Wall,
   "@": Tiger,
   "O": SmartPlantEater, // from previous exercise
   "*": Plant}
));
----

!!solution!!

Many of the same tricks that worked for in the previous exercise also
apply here. Making the predators big (large energy), and having them
reproduce slowly, is recommended. That'll make them less vulnerable to
periods of starvation when the herbivores are scarce.

Beyond staying alive, keeping its food stock alive is the critter's
main objective. It'd be useful to find some way to make it hunt more
aggressively when there are a lot of herbivores, and more slowly (or
not at all) when they are rare. Since the plant eaters move around,
the simple trick of only eating them when two are nearby is unlikely to
work—that'll happen so rarely that your critter will starve. But you
could keep track of observations in previous turns, in some data
structure kept on the critter objects, and have it base its behavior
on what it recently saw.

!!solution!!
