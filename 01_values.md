# Values, Types, and Operators

{{quote {author: "Master Yuan-Ma", title: "The Book of Programming", chapter: true}

Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort,
it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and
regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The
essence stays invisibly below.

{{index "Yuan-Ma", "Book of Programming"}}

{{figure {url: "img/chapter_picture_1.jpg", alt: "Picture of a sea of bits", chapter: framed}}}

{{index "binary data", data, bit, memory}}

Inside the computer's world, there is only data. You can read data,
modify data, create new data—but that which isn't data cannot be
mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is
thus fundamentally alike.

{{index CD, signal}}

_Bits_ are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and
ones. Inside the computer, they take forms such as a high or low
electrical charge, a strong or weak signal, or a shiny or dull spot on
the surface of a CD. Any piece of discrete information can be reduced
to a sequence of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits.

{{index "binary number", radix, "decimal number"}}

For example, we can express the number 13 in bits. It works the same
way as a decimal number, but instead of 10 different ((digit))s, you
have only 2, and the weight of each increases by a factor of 2 from
right to left. Here are the bits that make up the number 13, with the
weights of the digits shown below them:

```{lang: null}
   0   0   0   0   1   1   0   1
 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1
```

So that's the binary number 00001101, or 8 + 4 + 1, or 13.

## Values

{{index memory, "volatile data storage", "hard drive"}}

Imagine a sea of bits—an ocean of them. A typical modern computer has
more than 30 billion bits in its volatile data storage (working
memory). Nonvolatile storage (the hard disk or equivalent) tends to
have yet a few orders of magnitude more.

To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost,
we must separate them into chunks that represent pieces of
information. In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called
_((value))s_. Though all values are made of bits, they play different
roles. Every value has a ((type)) that determines its role. Some
values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values are
functions, and so on.

{{index "garbage collection"}}

To create a value, you must merely invoke its name. This is
convenient. You don't have to gather building material for your values
or pay for them. You just call for one, and _woosh_, you have it. They
are not really created from thin air, of course. Every value has to be
stored somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic amount of them at
the same time, you might run out of memory. Fortunately, this is a
problem only if you need them all simultaneously. As soon as you no
longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind its bits to be
recycled as building material for the next generation of values.

This chapter introduces the atomic elements of JavaScript programs,
that is, the simple value types and the operators that can act on such
values.

## Numbers

{{index syntax, number, [number, notation]}}

Values of the _number_ type are, unsurprisingly, numeric values. In a
JavaScript program, they are written as follows:

```
13
```

{{index "binary number"}}

Use that in a program, and it will cause the bit pattern for the
number 13 to come into existence inside the computer's memory.

{{index [number, representation], bit}}

JavaScript uses a fixed number of bits, namely 64 of them, to store a
single number value. There are only so many patterns you can make with
64 bits, which means that the amount of different numbers that can be
represented is limited. For _N_ decimal ((digit))s, the amount of
numbers that can be represented is 10^N^. Similarly, given 64 binary
digits, you can represent 2^64^ different numbers, which is about 18
quintillion (an 18 with 18 zeros after it). That's a lot.

Computer memory used to be much smaller, and people tended to use
groups of 8 or 16 bits to represent their numbers. It was easy to
accidentally _((overflow))_ such small numbers—to end up with a number
that did not fit into the given amount of bits. Today, even computers
that fit in your pocket have plenty of memory, so you are free to use
64-bit chunks, and you need to worry about overflow only when dealing
with truly astronomical numbers.

{{index sign, "floating-point number", "fractional number", "sign bit"}}

Not all whole numbers below 18 quintillion fit in a JavaScript number,
though. Those bits also store negative numbers, so one bit indicates
the sign of the number. A bigger issue is that nonwhole numbers must
also be represented. To do this, some of the bits are used to store
the position of the decimal point. The actual maximum whole number
that can be stored is more in the range of 9 quadrillion (15
zeros)—which is still pleasantly huge.

{{index [number, notation]}}

Fractional numbers are written by using a dot:

```
9.81
```

{{index exponent, "scientific notation", [number, notation]}}

For very big or very small numbers, you may also use scientific
notation by adding an _e_ (for _exponent_), followed by the exponent
of the number:

```
2.998e8
```

That is 2.998 × 10^8^ = 299,800,000.

{{index pi, [number, "precision of"], "floating-point number"}}

Calculations with whole numbers (also called _((integer))s_) smaller
than the aforementioned 9 quadrillion are guaranteed to always be
precise. Unfortunately, calculations with fractional numbers are
generally not. Just as π (pi) cannot be precisely expressed by a
finite number of decimal digits, many numbers lose some precision when
only 64 bits are available to store them. This is a shame, but it
causes practical problems only in specific situations. The important
thing is to be aware of it and treat fractional digital numbers as
approximations, not as precise values.

### Arithmetic

{{index syntax, operator, "binary operator", arithmetic, addition, multiplication}}

The main thing to do with numbers is arithmetic. Arithmetic operations
such as addition or multiplication take two number values and produce
a new number from them. Here is what they look like in JavaScript:

```
100 + 4 * 11
```

{{index [operator, application], asterisk, "plus character", "* operator", "+ operator"}}

The `+` and `*` symbols are called _operators_. The first stands for
addition, and the second stands for multiplication. Putting an
operator between two values will apply it to those values and produce
a new value.

{{index grouping, parentheses, precedence}}

But does the example mean "add 4 and 100, and multiply the result by 11,"
or is the multiplication done before the adding? As you might have
guessed, the multiplication happens first. But as in mathematics, you
can change this by wrapping the addition in parentheses:

```
(100 + 4) * 11
```

{{index "dash character", "slash character", division, subtraction, minus, "- operator", "/ operator"}}

For subtraction, there is the `-` operator, and division can be done
with the `/` operator.

When operators appear together without parentheses, the order in which
they are applied is determined by the _((precedence))_ of the
operators. The example shows that multiplication comes before
addition. The `/` operator has the same precedence as `*`. Likewise
for `+` and `-`. When multiple operators with the same precedence
appear next to each other, as in `1 - 2 + 1`, they are applied left to
right: `(1 - 2) + 1`.

These rules of precedence are not something you should worry about.
When in doubt, just add parentheses.

{{index "modulo operator", division, "remainder operator", "% operator"}}

There is one more arithmetic operator, which you might not immediately
recognize. The `%` symbol is used to represent the _remainder_
operation. `X % Y` is the remainder of dividing `X` by `Y`. For
example, `314 % 100` produces `14`, and `144 % 12` gives `0`.
Remainder's precedence is the same as that of multiplication and
division. You'll also often see this operator referred to as _modulo_.

### Special numbers

{{index [number, "special values"]}}

There are three special values in JavaScript that are considered
numbers but don't behave like normal numbers.

{{index infinity}}

The first two are `Infinity` and `-Infinity`, which represent the
positive and negative infinities. `Infinity - 1` is still `Infinity`,
and so on. Don't put too much trust in infinity-based computation,
though. It isn't mathematically sound, and it will quickly lead to our
next special number: `NaN`.

{{index NaN, "not a number", "division by zero"}}

`NaN` stands for "not a number", even though it _is_ a value of the
number type. You'll get this result when you, for example, try to
calculate `0 / 0` (zero divided by zero), `Infinity - Infinity`, or
any number of other numeric operations that don't yield a meaningful
result.

## Strings

{{indexsee "grave accent", backtick}}

{{index syntax, text, character, [string, notation], "single-quote character", "double-quote character", "quotation mark", backtick}}

The next basic data type is the _((string))_. Strings are used to
represent text. They are written by enclosing their content in quotes:

```
`Down on the sea`
"Lie on the ocean"
'Float on the ocean'
```

You can use single quotes, double quotes, or backticks to mark
strings, as long as the quotes at the start and the end of the string
match.

{{index "line break", "newline character"}}

Almost anything can be put between quotes, and JavaScript will make a
string value out of it. But a few characters are more difficult. You
can imagine how putting quotes between quotes might be hard.
_Newlines_ (the characters you get when you press Enter) may be
included without escaping only when the string is quoted with backticks
(`` ` ``).

{{index [escaping, "in strings"], "backslash character"}}

To make it possible to include such characters in a string, the
following notation is used: whenever a backslash (`\`) is found inside
quoted text, it indicates that the character after it has a special
meaning. This is called _escaping_ the character. A quote that is
preceded by a backslash will not end the string but be part of it.
When an `n` character occurs after a backslash, it is interpreted as a
newline. Similarly, a `t` after a backslash means a ((tab character)).
Take the following string:

```
"This is the first line\nAnd this is the second"
```

The actual text contained is this:

```{lang: null}
This is the first line
And this is the second
```

There are, of course, situations where you want a backslash in a
string to be just a backslash, not a special code. If two backslashes
follow each other, they will collapse together, and only one will be
left in the resulting string value. This is how the string "_A newline
character is written like `"`\n`"`._" can be expressed:

```
"A newline character is written like \"\\n\"."
```

{{id unicode}}

{{index [string, representation], Unicode, character}}

Strings, too, have to be modeled as a series of bits to be able to
exist inside the computer. The way JavaScript does this is based on
the _((Unicode))_ standard. This standard assigns a number to
virtually every character you would ever need, including characters
from Greek, Arabic, Japanese, Armenian, and so on. If we have a number
for every character, a string can be described by a sequence of
numbers.

{{index "UTF-16", emoji}}

And that's what JavaScript does. But there's a complication:
JavaScript's representation uses 16 bits per string element, which can
describe up to 2^16^ different characters. But Unicode defines more
characters than that—about twice as many, at this point. So some
characters, such as many emoji, take up two "character positions" in
JavaScript strings. We'll come back to this in [Chapter
?](higher_order#code_units).

{{index "+ operator", concatenation}}

Strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted, but the `+`
operator _can_ be used on them. It does not add, but it
_concatenates_—it glues two strings together. The following line will
produce the string `"concatenate"`:

```
"con" + "cat" + "e" + "nate"
```

String values have a number of associated functions (_methods_) that
can be used to perform other operations on them. We'll come back to
these in [Chapter ?](data#methods).

{{index interpolation, backtick}}

Strings written with single or double quotes behave very much the
same—the only difference is in which type of quote you need to escape
inside of them. Backtick-quoted strings, usually called _((template
literals))_, can do a few more tricks. Apart from being able to span
lines, they can also embed other values.

```
`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`
```

When you write something inside `${}` in a template literal, its
result will be computed, converted to a string, and included at that
position. The example produces "_half of 100 is 50_".

## Unary operators

{{index operator, "typeof operator", type}}

Not all operators are symbols. Some are written as words. One example
is the `typeof` operator, which produces a string value naming the
type of the value you give it.

```
console.log(typeof 4.5)
// → number
console.log(typeof "x")
// → string
```

{{index "console.log", output, "JavaScript console"}}

{{id "console.log"}}

We will use `console.log` in example code to indicate that we want to
see the result of evaluating something. More about that in the [next
chapter](program_structure).

{{index negation, "- operator", "binary operator", "unary operator"}}

The other operators we saw all operated on two values, but `typeof`
takes only one. Operators that use two values are called _binary_
operators, while those that take one are called _unary_ operators. The
minus operator can be used both as a binary operator and as a unary
operator.

```
console.log(- (10 - 2))
// → -8
```

## Boolean values

{{index Boolean, operator, true, false, bit}}

It is often useful to have a value that distinguishes between only two
possibilities, like "yes" and "no" or "on" and "off". For this
purpose, JavaScript has a _Boolean_ type, which has just two values:
true and false, which are written as those words.

### Comparison

{{index comparison}}

Here is one way to produce Boolean values:

```
console.log(3 > 2)
// → true
console.log(3 < 2)
// → false
```

{{index [comparison, "of numbers"], "> operator", "< operator", "greater than", "less than"}}

The `>` and `<` signs are the traditional symbols for "is greater
than" and "is less than", respectively. They are binary operators.
Applying them results in a Boolean value that indicates whether they
hold true in this case.

Strings can be compared in the same way.

```
console.log("Aardvark" < "Zoroaster")
// → true
```

{{index [comparison, "of strings"]}}

The way strings are ordered is roughly alphabetic, but not really what
you'd expect to see in a dictionary: uppercase letters are always
"less" than lowercase ones, so `"Z" < "a"`, and nonalphabetic
characters (!, -, and so on) are also included in the ordering. When
comparing strings, JavaScript goes over the characters from left to
right, comparing the ((Unicode)) codes one by one.

{{index equality, ">= operator", "<= operator", "== operator", "!= operator"}}

Other similar operators are `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=`
(less than or equal to), `==` (equal to), and `!=` (not equal to).

```
console.log("Itchy" != "Scratchy")
// → true
console.log("Apple" == "Orange")
// → false
```

{{index [comparison, "of NaN"], NaN}}

There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and
that is `NaN` ("not a number").

```
console.log(NaN == NaN)
// → false
```

`NaN` is supposed to denote the result of a nonsensical computation,
and as such, it isn't equal to the result of any _other_ nonsensical
computations.

### Logical operators

{{index reasoning, "logical operators"}}

There are also some operations that can be applied to Boolean values
themselves. JavaScript supports three logical operators: _and_, _or_,
and _not_. These can be used to "reason" about Booleans.

{{index "&& operator", "logical and"}}

The `&&` operator represents logical _and_. It is a binary operator,
and its result is true only if both the values given to it are true.

```
console.log(true && false)
// → false
console.log(true && true)
// → true
```

{{index "|| operator", "logical or"}}

The `||` operator denotes logical _or_. It produces true if either of
the values given to it is true.

```
console.log(false || true)
// → true
console.log(false || false)
// → false
```

{{index negation, "! operator"}}

_Not_ is written as an exclamation mark (`!`). It is a unary operator
that flips the value given to it—`!true` produces `false` and `!false`
gives `true`.

{{index precedence}}

When mixing these Boolean operators with arithmetic and other
operators, it is not always obvious when parentheses are needed. In
practice, you can usually get by with knowing that of the operators we
have seen so far, `||` has the lowest precedence, then comes `&&`,
then the comparison operators (`>`, `==`, and so on), and then the
rest. This order has been chosen such that, in typical expressions
like the following one, as few parentheses as possible are necessary:

```
1 + 1 == 2 && 10 * 10 > 50
```

{{index "conditional execution", "ternary operator", "?: operator", "conditional operator", "colon character", "question mark"}}

The last logical operator I will discuss is not unary, not binary, but
_ternary_, operating on three values. It is written with a question
mark and a colon, like this:

```
console.log(true ? 1 : 2);
// → 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2);
// → 2
```

This one is called the _conditional_ operator (or sometimes just
_ternary_ operator since it is the only such operator in the
language). The value on the left of the question mark "picks" which of
the other two values will come out. When it is true, it chooses the
middle value, and when it is false, the value on the right.

## Empty values

{{index undefined, null}}

There are two special values, written `null` and `undefined`, that are
used to denote the absence of a _meaningful_ value. They are
themselves values, but they carry no information.

Many operations in the language that don't produce a meaningful value
(you'll see some later) yield `undefined` simply because they have to
yield _some_ value.

The difference in meaning between `undefined` and `null` is an accident
of JavaScript's design, and it doesn't matter most of the time. In the cases
where you actually have to concern yourself with these values, I
recommend treating them as mostly interchangeable.

## Automatic type conversion

{{index NaN, "type coercion"}}

In the Introduction, I mentioned that JavaScript goes out of its way
to accept almost any program you give it, even programs that do odd
things. This is nicely demonstrated by the following expressions:

```
console.log(8 * null)
// → 0
console.log("5" - 1)
// → 4
console.log("5" + 1)
// → 51
console.log("five" * 2)
// → NaN
console.log(false == 0)
// → true
```

{{index "+ operator", arithmetic, "* operator", "- operator"}}

When an operator is applied to the "wrong" type of value, JavaScript
will quietly convert that value to the type it needs, using a set of
rules that often aren't what you want or expect. This is called
_((type coercion))_. The `null` in the first expression becomes `0`,
and the `"5"` in the second expression becomes `5` (from string to
number). Yet in the third expression, `+` tries string concatenation
before numeric addition, so the `1` is converted to `"1"` (from number
to string).

{{index "type coercion", [number, "conversion to"]}}

When something that doesn't map to a number in an obvious way (such as
`"five"` or `undefined`) is converted to a number, you get the value
`NaN`. Further arithmetic operations on `NaN` keep producing `NaN`, so
if you find yourself getting one of those in an unexpected place, look
for accidental type conversions.

{{index null, undefined, [comparison, "of undefined values"], "== operator"}}

When comparing values of the same type using `==`, the outcome is easy
to predict: you should get true when both values are the same, except
in the case of `NaN`. But when the types differ, JavaScript uses a
complicated and confusing set of rules to determine what to do. In
most cases, it just tries to convert one of the values to the other
value's type. However, when `null` or `undefined` occurs on either
side of the operator, it produces true only if both sides are one of
`null` or `undefined`.

```
console.log(null == undefined);
// → true
console.log(null == 0);
// → false
```

That behavior is often useful. When you want to test whether a value
has a real value instead of `null` or `undefined`, you can compare it
to `null` with the `==` (or `!=`) operator.

{{index "type coercion", [Boolean, "conversion to"], "=== operator", "!== operator", comparison}}

But what if you want to test whether something refers to the precise
value `false`? The rules for converting strings and numbers to Boolean
values state that `0`, `NaN`, and the empty string (`""`) count as
`false`, while all the other values count as `true`. Because of this,
expressions like `0 == false` and `"" == false` are also true. When
you do _not_ want any automatic type conversions to happen, there are
two additional operators: `===` and `!==`. The first tests whether a
value is _precisely_ equal to the other, and the second tests whether
it is not precisely equal. So `"" === false` is false as expected.

I recommend using the three-character comparison operators defensively to
prevent unexpected type conversions from tripping you up. But when you're
certain the types on both sides will be the same, there is no problem with
using the shorter operators.

### Short-circuiting of logical operators

{{index "type coercion", [Boolean, "conversion to"], operator}}

The logical operators `&&` and `||` handle values of different types
in a peculiar way. They will convert the value on their left side to
Boolean type in order to decide what to do, but depending on the
operator and the result of that conversion, they will return either the
_original_ left-hand value or the right-hand value.

{{index "|| operator"}}

The `||` operator, for example, will return the value to its left when
that can be converted to true and will return the value on its right
otherwise. This has the expected effect when the values are Boolean,
and does something analogous for values of other types.

```
console.log(null || "user")
// → user
console.log("Agnes" || "user")
// → Agnes
```

{{index "default value"}}

We can use this functionality as a way to fall back on a default
value. If you have a value that might be empty, you can put `||` after
it with a replacement value. If the initial value can be converted to
false, you'll get the replacement instead.

{{index "&& operator"}}

The `&&` operator works similarly, but the other way around. When the
value to its left is something that converts to false, it returns that
value, and otherwise it returns the value on its right.

Another important property of these two operators is that the part to
their right is evaluated only when necessary. In the case of `true ||
X`, no matter what `X` is—even if it's a piece of program that does
something _terrible_—the result will be true, and `X` is never
evaluated. The same goes for `false && X`, which is false and will
ignore `X`. This is called _((short-circuit evaluation))_.

{{index "ternary operator", "?: operator", "conditional operator"}}

The conditional operator works in a similar way. Of the second and
third value, only the one that is selected is evaluated.

## Summary

We looked at four types of JavaScript values in this chapter: numbers,
strings, Booleans, and undefined values.

Such values are created by typing in their name (`true`, `null`) or
value (`13`, `"abc"`). You can combine and transform values with
operators. We saw binary operators for arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`,
and `%`), string concatenation (`+`), comparison (`==`, `!=`, `===`,
`!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), and logic (`&&`, `||`), as well as
several unary operators (`-` to negate a number, `!` to negate
logically, and `typeof` to find a value's type) and a ternary operator
(`?:`) to pick one of two values based on a third value.

This gives you enough information to use JavaScript as a pocket
calculator, but not much more. The [next
chapter](program_structure) will start tying
these expressions together into basic programs.
