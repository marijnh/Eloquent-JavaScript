= Functions =

(((function)))You've seen function values, and how to call them.
Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The
concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It is
a tool to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to
associate names with sub-programs, and to isolate these sub-programs
from each other.

The most obvious application of functions is defining new vocabulary.
Creating new words left and right in regular, human-language prose is
usually bad style. In programming, it is indispensable.

Typical adult English speakers have some twenty thousand words in
their vocabulary. Very few programming languages come with twenty
thousand concepts built in. And the vocabulary that _is_ available
tends to be more precisely defined, and thus less flexible, than
spoken language words. Thus, we usually _have_ to add some of our own
vocabulary to avoid repeating ourselves all too much.

== Defining a function ==

(((function,definition)))A function definition is
just a regular variable definition where the value given to the
variable happens to be a function. For example, this defines the
variable `square` to refer to a function that produces the square of a
given number:

[source,javascript]
----
var square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
};

console.log(square(12));
// → 144
----

(((function, keyword)))(((function,body)))A function is created by an
expression that starts with the keyword `function`. Functions have a
set of parameters (in this case, only `x`), and a “body”, containing
the statements that are to be executed when the function is called.
These must always be wrapped in braces, even when the body consists of
only a single statement (as in the example).

A function can have multiple parameters, or no parameters at all.

[source,javascript]
----
var makeNoise = function() {
  console.log("Pling!");
};

makeNoise();
// → Pling!

var power = function(base, exponent) {
  var result = 1;
  for (var count = 0; count < exponent; count++)
    result *= base;
  return result;
}

console.log(power(2, 10));
// → 1024
----

(((return keyword)))Some functions produce a value, such as `power`
and `square`, and some don't, such as `makeNoise` (which only has a
side effect). A `return` statement is used to determine the value the
function returns. When control comes across such a statement, it
immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned
value to the code that called the function. The `return` keyword
without an expression after it will cause the function to return
`undefined`.

== Parameters and scopes ==

(((variable)))The parameters to a function behave like variables—but
ones that are given an initial value by the _caller_ of the function,
not the code in the function itself.

(((variable,scope)))(((local variable)))A very important property of
functions is that the variables created inside of them, including
their parameters, are _local_ to the function. This means, for
example, that the `result` variable in the `power` example will be
newly created every time the function is called and will no longer
exist after the function returns.

indexsee:[top-level variable,global variable]

(((var keyword)))(((global variable)))This “localness” of variables
applies only to the parameters and variables declared with the `var`
keyword inside the function body. It is possible to access _global_
(non-local) variables from inside a function, as long as you haven't
declared a local variable with the same name.

The following code demonstrates this. It defines (and calls) two
functions that both change the value of the variable `x`. The first
one does not declare the variable as local and thus changes the global
variable defined at the start of the example. The second does declare
it, and thus all references to `x` inside of it refer to the local
`x`, which is an entirely different variable than the global `x`.

[source,javascript]
----
var x = "A";

var setXToB = function() {
  x = "B";
};
setXToB();
console.log(x);
// → B

var setXToC = function() {
  var x;
  x = "C";
};
setXToC();
console.log(x);
// → B
----

This behavior helps prevent accidental interference between functions.
If all variables were shared by the whole program, it'd take a lot of
effort, in all but the tiniest programs, to make sure no name is used
twice. And if you _did_ reuse a variable name, you would see strange
effects, as unrelated code messes with the value of your variable. By
treating function-local variables as existing only within the
function, the language makes it easier to read and understand
functions as small universes, without too action-at-a-distance
complicating things.

== Nested scope ==

(((variable,scope)))(((inner function)))(((nested functions)))
(((lexical scoping)))In JavaScript, the distinction is not just
between _global_ and _local_ variables. In fact, there are degrees of
locality. Functions can be created anywhere in the program, including
inside other functions.

For example, this rather nonsensical function has two functions inside
of it:

[source,javascript]
----
var landscape = function() {
  var result = "";
  var flat = function(size) {
    for (var count = 0; count < size; count++)
      result += "_";
  };
  var mountain = function(size) {
    result += "/";
    for (var count = 0; count < size; count++)
      result += "'";
    result += "\\";
  };
 
  flat(3);
  mountain(4);
  flat(6);
  mountain(1);
  flat(1);
  return result;
};

console.log(landscape());
// → ___/''''\______/'\_
----

The `flat` and `mountain` function can “see” the variable called
`result`, since they are inside of the function that defines it. But
they can not see each other's `count` variables, only their own, since
they are outside of each other. The environment outside of the
function doesn't see any of the variables defined inside of
`landscape`.

In short, each local scope can also see all the local scopes that it
is inside of. The set of variables visible inside a function is
determined by the place of that function in the program text. All
variables from blocks “around” a function's definition are visible,
which means both those in function bodies that enclose it and those at
the top level of the program. This approach to variable visibility is
called _lexical scoping_.

((({} (block))))People who have experience with other programming
languages might expect that any block of code (between braces)
produces a new local environment. But in JavaScript, functions are the
only things that create a new scope. You are allowed to use
free-standing blocks:

[source,javascript]
----
var something = 1;
{
  var something = 2;
  // Do stuff with variable something...
}
// Outside of the block again...
----

But the `something` inside the block refers to the same variable
as the one outside the block. In fact, although blocks like this are
allowed, they are only useful to group the body of an `if`
statement or a loop.

If you find this odd, you're not alone. The next version of JavaScript
will introduce a `let` keyword, which works like `var`, but creates a
variable that is local to the enclosing _block_, not the enclosing
_function_.

== Functions as values ==

(((function,as value)))Usually, function variables simply act as names
for a specific piece of the program. They are defined once, and never
change. This makes it easy to start confusing the function and its
name.

But the two are different. A function value can do all the things that
other values can do—you can use it in all kinds of expressions, not
just call it. It is possible to store such a value in a new place, or
pass it an argument to a function, and so on. Similarly, a variable
that holds a function is still just a regular variable, and can be
assigned a new value.

[source,javascript]
----
var announce = function(text) {
  console.log("Hey, you, " + text + "!");
};
if (prompt("Who are you?", "") == "royalty") {
  announce = function(text) {
    console.log("Your majesty, " + text + ".");
  }
}
announce("it is done");
----

In chapter 5, we will discuss the wonderful things that can be done by
passing around function values to other functions.

== Declaration notation ==

There is a slightly shorter way to say “++var x = function…++”. The
`function` keyword can also be used at the start of a statement, to
produce a function declaration statement.

[source,javascript]
----
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
----

This defines the variable `square` and points it at the given
function. So far so good. There is one subtlety with this form of
function definition:

[source,javascript]
----
console.log("The future says:", future());

function future() {
  return "We STILL have no flying cars.";
}
----

Such definitions are not part of the regular top-to-bottom flow of
control. They are conceptually moved to the top, and can be used by
all the code in the same scope. This is sometimes useful—it allows you
to put the interesting code at the top, and still use functions
defined further down.

What happens when you put such a function definition inside of a
conditional (`if`) block, or a loop? Well, don't do that. Different
JavaScript platforms (in browsers) have traditionally done different
things in that situation, and the latest standard actually forbids it.
So if you want your programs to behave consistently, only use this
form of function-defining statements in the outermost block of a
function or program.

[source,javascript]
----
function example() {
  function a() {} // Okay
  if (something) {
    function b() {} // Danger!
  }
}
----

== The call stack ==

indexsee:[stack,call stack]

(((call stack)))(((function,application)))I believe it will be helpful
to take a closer look at the way control flows through functions. Here
is a simple program making a few function calls:

[source,javascript]
----
function greet(who) {
  console.log("Hello " + who);
}
greet("Harry");
console.log("Bye");
----

A run through this program goes roughly like this: The call to `greet`
causes control to jump to the start of that function (line 2), which
calls `console.log` (a built-in browser function), allowing that take
control. It eventually finishes, causing control to return to line 2.
We reach the end of the `greet` function, so we return back to place
that called it, at line 4. The line after that calls `console.log`
again. We could show the flow of control schematically like this:

....
top
   greet
        console.log
   greet
top
   console.log
top
....

Since a function, when returning, has to jump back to the place of the
call, the computer must remember the context from which the function
was called. In one case, `console.log` had to jump back to the
`greet` function. In the other case, it jumps back to the end of the
program.

The place where this context is stored is the _call stack_. Every time
a function is called, the current context is put on top of this
“stack” of contexts. When the function returns, it takes the top
context from the stack, and uses it to continue execution.

(((stack overflow)))(((recursion)))This stack requires space in the
computer's memory to be stored. When the stack grows too big, the
computer will give up with a message like “out of stack space” or “too
much recursion.” The following code illustrates that—it asks the
computer a really hard question, which causes an infinite
back-and-forth between two functions. Or rather, it would be infinite,
if we had an infinite stack. As it is, it will run out of space, or
“blow the stack.”

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
function chicken() {
  return egg();
}
function egg() {
  return chicken();
}
console.log(chicken() + " came first.");
// → ??
----

== Optional Arguments ==

(((argument)))(((function,application)))The following call to `alert`
is allowed:

[source,javascript]
----
alert("Hello", "Good Evening", "How do you do?");
----

(((alert function)))The function `alert` officially accepts only one
argument. Yet when you call it like this, it does not complain. It
simply ignores the other arguments and shows you “Hello.”

(((undefined value)))JavaScript is extremely broad-minded about the
amount of arguments you pass to a function. If you pass too many, the
extra ones are ignored. If you pass too few, the variables for the
missing parameters simply get the value `undefined`.

The downside of this is that it is possible—likely, even—that you'll
accidentally pass the wrong number of arguments to functions... and no
one will tell you about it.

indexsee:[optional argument,argument optional]

(((argument,optional)))The upside is that this behavior can be used to
have a function take “optional” arguments. For example, this version
of `power` can be called either with two arguments or with a single
argument, in which case the exponent is assumed to be two, and it
behaves like `square`.

// test: wrap

[source,javascript]
----
function power(base, exponent) {
  if (exponent == undefined)
    exponent = 2;
  var result = 1;
  for (var count = 0; count < exponent; count++)
    result *= base;
  return result;
}

console.log(power(4));
// → 16
console.log(power(4, 3));
// → 64
----

In the next chapter, we will see a way in which a function body can
get at the exact list of arguments that were passed. This is helpful
because it makes it possible for a function to accept any number of
arguments. `console.log` makes use of this—it outputs all of the
values it is given.

[source,javascript]
----
console.log("R", 2, "D", 2);
----

== Closure ==

(((closure)))(((variable,scope)))The ability to treat functions as
values, combined with the fact that local variables are “recreated”
every time a function is called, brings up an interesting question.
What happens to local variables when the function call that created
them is no longer active? The following code illustrates this:

[source,javascript]
----
function wrapNumber(n) {
  var localVariable = n;
  return function(){ return localVariable; };
}

var wrap1 = wrapNumber(1);
var wrap2 = wrapNumber(2);
console.log(wrap1());
// → 1
console.log(wrap2());
// → 2
----

When `wrapNumber` is called, it creates a local variable that stores
its parameter, and then returns a function that returns this local
variable. This is allowed, and works as you'd expect—the variable
survives. In fact, multiple instances of the variable can be alive at
the same time, which is another good illustration of the concept that
local variables really are recreated for every call—different calls
can not trample on each other's local variables.

This feature, being able to reference specific instance of local
variables in an enclosing function, is called _closure_. A function
that “closes over” some local variables is called _a closure_. This
behavior not only frees you from having to worry about lifetimes of
variables, but also allows for some creative use of function values.

With a slight change, we can turn the example function into a way to
create functions that multiply by an arbitrary amount:

[source,javascript]
----
function multiplier(factor) {
  return function(number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

var twice = multiplier(2);
console.log(twice(5));
// → 10
----

The explicit local variable from the `wrapNumber` example isn't
needed, since a parameter is itself a local variable.

== Recursion ==

(((recursion)))(((function,application)))It is perfectly okay for a
function to call itself. A function that calls itself is called
_recursive_. Recursion allows some functions to be written in a funny
way. For example this alternative implementation of `power`:

// test: wrap

[source,javascript]
----
function power(base, exponent) {
  if (exponent == 0)
    return 1;
  else
    return base * power(base, exponent - 1);
}

console.log(power(2, 3));
// → 8
----

This is rather close to the way mathematicians define exponentiation,
and arguably describes the concept in a more elegant way than the
looping variant does. The function calls itself multiple times with
different arguments to achieve the repeated multiplication.

(((stack overflow)))There is one important problem: In typical
JavaScript implementations, this second version is about 10 times
slower than the first one. Running running through a simple loop is a
_lot_ cheaper than calling a function multiple times. On top of that,
using a sufficiently large exponent to this function might cause the
stack to overflow.

(((efficiency)))The dilemma of speed versus (((elegance)))elegance is
an interesting one. Almost any program can be made faster by making it
bigger and more convoluted. You can see this as a kind of continuum
between human-friendliness and machine-friendliness.

In the case of the earlier `power` function, the inelegant (looping)
version is still sufficiently simple and easy to read. It does not
make much sense to replace it with the recursive version. Often,
though, the concepts a program is dealing with get so complex that
giving up some efficiency in order to make the program more
straightforward becomes an attractive choice.

The basic rule, which has been repeated by many programmers and with
which I wholeheartedly agree, is to not worry about efficiency until
you know for sure that the program is too slow. When it is, find out
which parts are taking up the most time, and start exchanging elegance
for efficiency in those parts.

Of course, the previous rule doesn't mean one should start ignoring
performance altogether. In many cases, like the `power` function,
not much simplicity is gained by the “elegant” approach. In other
cases, an experienced programmer can see right away that a simple
approach is never going to be fast enough.

(((premature optimization)))The reason I am stressing this is that
surprisingly many beginning programmers focus fanatically on
efficiency, even in the smallest details. The result is bigger, more
complicated, and often less correct programs, which take longer to
write than their more straightforward equivalents and run only
marginally faster.

Anyway, recursion is not always just a less-efficient alternative to
looping. Some problems are much easier to solve with recursion than
with loops. Most often these are problems that require exploring or
processing several “branches,” each of which might branch out again
into more branches.

Consider this puzzle: By starting from the number 1 and repeatedly
either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite amount of new numbers
can be produced. How would you write a function that, given a number,
tries to find a sequence of additions and multiplications that produce
that number?

For example, the number 13 could be reached by first multiplying by 3
and then adding 5 twice. The number 15 cannot be reached at all.

Here is a recursive solution:

[source,javascript]
----
function findSolution(goal) {
  function find(start, history) {
    if (start == goal)
      return history;
    else if (start > goal)
      return null;
    else
      return find(start + 5, "(" + history + " + 5)") ||
             find(start * 3, "(" + history + " * 3)");
  }
  return find(1, "1");
}

console.log(findSolution(24));
// → (((1 * 3) + 5) * 3)
----

Note that it doesn't necessarily find the _shortest_ sequence of
operations—it is satisfied when it finds any sequence at all.

I don't necessarily expect you to see how it works right away. But let
us work through it, since it makes for a great exercise in recursive
thinking.

The inner function `find` does the actual recursing. It takes two
arguments, the current number and a string that records how we reached
this number, and returns either a string that shows how to get to the
goal number, or `null`.

(((|| operator)))(((shortcut evaluation)))In order to do this, it
performs one of three actions. If the current number is the goal
number, the current history is a way to reach the goal, so it is
simply returned. If the current number is greater than the goal, there
is no sense in further exploring this history, since both of the
possible steps will only make the number bigger. And finally, if we're
still below the goal, the function tries all possible paths that start
from the current number, by calling itself twice, once for both of the
allowed next steps. If the first call returns something that is not
`null`, it is returned. Otherwise, the second call is returned
(regardless of whether it produces a string or `null`).

How does this simple function produce the effect we are looking for?
Let us look at a the calls to `find` that are made when searching for
a solution for the number 13:

....
find(1, "1")
  find(6, "(1 + 5)")
    find(11, "((1 + 5) + 5)")
      find(16, "(((1 + 5) + 5) + 5)")
        too big
      find(33, "((1 + 5) + 5)")
        too big
    find(18, "((1 + 5) * 3)")
      too big
  find(3, "(1 * 3)")
    find(8, "((1 * 3) + 5)")
      find(13, "(((1 * 3) + 5) + 5)")
        found!
....

The indentation suggests the depth of the call stack. The first call
to `find` itself calls `find` twice, to explore the solutions that
start with `(1 + 5)` and `(1 * 3)`. The first call fails to find a
solution that starts with ++(1 + 5)++—using recursion, it explores
_all_ such solutions that yield a number smaller than the goal number.
Thus, it returns `null`, and the “||” operator causes the call that
explores `(1 * 3)` to happen. This one has more luck, its first
recursive call, through _another_ recursive call, hits upon our goal
number 13. Thus, a string is returned, and each of the “||” operators
in the intermediate calls ends up letting through that string, which
is our solution.

== Growing functions ==

There are two more or less natural ways for functions to be introduced
into programs.

The first is that you find yourself writing very similar code multiple
times. We want to avoid doing that—having more code means more space
for mistakes to hide, and more material to read for people trying to
understand the program. So we take the repeated functionality, find a
good name for it, and put it into a function.

The second way is that you find you need some functionality that you
haven't written yet, and that sounds like it deserves its own
function. You'll start by naming the function, and then write its
body. You might even first write another piece of code that already
uses the function, before you create the function itself.

How difficult it is to find a good name for a function is a good
indication of how clear a concept it is that you're trying to wrap.
Let us go through an example.

We want to write a program that prints two numbers, the amounts of
cows and chickens on our farm, with the words `Cows` and `Chickens`
after them, and zeroes padded before both numbers so that they are
always three digits long.

....
007 Cows
011 Chickens
....

Well, that clearly is a function of two arguments. Let's get coding.

[source,javascript]
----
function printFarmInventory(cows, chickens) {
  var cowString = String(cows);
  while (cowString.length < 3)
    cowString = "0" + cowString;
  console.log(cowString + " Cows");
  var chickenString = String(chickens);
  while (chickenString.length < 3)
    chickenString = "0" + chickenString;
  console.log(chickenString + " Chickens");
}
printFarmInventory(7, 11);
----

Adding `.length` after a string value will give us the length of that
string. Thus, the `while` loops keep putting zeroes in front of the
number strings until they are at least three characters long.

Mission accomplished! But just as we want to send him the code (along
with a hefty invoice of course), the farmer calls and tells us he's
also started keeping pigs, and couldn't we please extend the software
to also print pigs.

We sure can. But just as we're in the process of copy-pasting those
four lines one more time, we stop and reconsider. There has to be a
better way. Here's a first attempt:

[source,javascript]
----
function printZeroPaddedWithLabel(number, label) {
  var numberString = String(number);
  while (numberString.length < 3)
    numberString = "0" + numberString;
  console.log(numberString + " " + label);
}

function printFarmInventory(cows, chickens, pigs) {
  printZeroPaddedWithLabel(cows, "Cows");
  printZeroPaddedWithLabel(chickens, "Chickens");
  printZeroPaddedWithLabel(pigs, "Pigs");
}

printFarmInventory(7, 11, 3);
----

It works! But that name, `printZeroPaddedWithLabel`, is a little
awkward. It conflates three things—printing, zero-padding, and adding
a label—in a single function.

If, instead of lifting out the repeated part of our program wholesale,
we try to pick out a _concept_, we can do better:

[source,javascript]
----
function zeroPad(number, width) {
  var string = String(number);
  while (string.length < width)
    string = "0" + string;
  return string;
}

function printFarmInventory(cows, chickens, pigs) {
  console.log(zeroPad(cows, 3) + " Cows");
  console.log(zeroPad(chickens, 3) + " Chickens");
  console.log(zeroPad(pigs, 3) + " Pigs");
}

printFarmInventory(7, 16, 3);
----

`zeroPad` has a nice, obvious name, which makes it easier for someone
who reads the code to figure out what it does. And it is useful in
more situations that just this specific program. For example, you
could use it to print nicely aligned tables of numbers.

How smart and versatile should our function be? We could write
anything from a terribly simple function that simply pads a number so
that it's three characters wide, to a complicated generalized
number-formatting system that handles fractional numbers, negative
numbers, aligning of dots, padding with different characters, and so
on.

A useful principle is to not add cleverness unless you are absolutely
sure you are going to need it. It can be tempting to write general
“frameworks” for every little bit of functionality you need. Resist
that urge. You won't get any real work done, and you'll end up writing
a lot of code that no one will ever use.

== Functions and side effects ==

(((side effect)))(((pure function)))(((function,purity)))Functions can
roughly be divided into those that are called for their side effects,
and those that are called for their return value. (Though it is
definitely also possible to have both side effects and return a
value.)

The first helper function in the farm example,
`printZeroPaddedWithLabel`, is called for its side effect (it prints a
line). The second, `zeroPad`, is called for its return value. It is no
coincidence that the second is useful in more situations than the
first. Functions that create values are easier to combine in new ways
than functions that directly perform a side effect.

A _pure_ function is a specific kind of value-producing function that
not only has no side effects, but also doesn't rely on side effects
from other code—for example, it doesn't read variables that are
occasionally changed by other code. A pure function has the pleasant
property that, when called with the same arguments, it always produces
the same value (and doesn't do anything else). This makes it easy to
think about—a call to it can be mentally substituted by its result
without changing the meaning of the code. When you are not sure that
such a function is working correctly, you can test it by simply
calling it and know that if it works in that context, it will work in
any context. Non-pure functions might return different values based on
all kinds of factors and have side effects that might be hard to test
and think about.

Still, there is no need to feel bad when writing functions that are
not pure, no need to start a holy war and purge all code of
impurities. Side effects are often useful. There'd be no way to write
a pure `console.log`, for example, and `console.log` is certainly
useful. Some operations also become more expensive when done without
side effect, since all data involved must be copied, rather than
modified.

== Summary ==

This chapter taught you how to write our own functions. The `function`
keyword, when used as an expression, can create a function value. When
used as a statement, it can be used to declare a variable and give it
a function as its value.

[source,javascript]
----
// Create a function and immediately call it
(function (a) { console.log(a + 2); })(4);
// → 6

// Declare f to be a function
function f(a, b) {
  return a * b * 3.5;
}
----

A key aspect in understanding functions is understanding local scopes.
Parameters and variables declared inside a function are local to the
function, recreated every time the function is called, and not visible
from the outside. Functions declared inside another function have
access to the outer function's local scope.

Separating the different tasks your program performs into different
functions is helpful. You won't have to repeat yourself so much, and
when someone is trying to read the program, they can play the same
role that chapters and sections play in regular text.

== Exercises ==

The previous chapter introduced the standard function `Math.min` that
returns the smallest of its arguments. We can do that ourselves now.

If you have trouble putting braces and parentheses in the right place
to get a valid function definition, simply start by copying one of the
examples in this chapter and modifying it.

A function may contain multiple `return` statements.

=== Recursion ===

We've seen that `% 2` (the remainder operator) can be used to test
whether a number is divisible by 2, i.e. whether it is even or odd.
Here's another way to define whether a (positive, whole) number is
even or odd:

- Zero is even.

- One is odd.

- For any other number N, the evenness is the same as N - 2.

Define a recursive function `isEven` corresponding to this
description. The function accepts a number parameter and returns a
boolean.

Test it out on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think
of a way to fix this?

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
// Your code here.

console.log(isEven(50));
// → true
console.log(isEven(75));
// → false
console.log(isEven(-1));
// → ??

endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

Your function will somewhat similar to the inner `find` function in
the recursive `findSolution` example in this chapter. It has an
`if`/`else if`/`else` chain that tests which of the three cases
applies, with the final `else` making a recursive call. Each of the
branches should contain a `return` statement, or in some other way
arrange for a specific value to be returned.

When given a negative number, the function will recurse again and
again, giving itself an ever more negative number, and thus only
getting further and further away from the input that allows it to
return a result. It will eventually run out of stack space and abort.

!!solution!!

=== Bean counting ===

You can get the Nth character (letter) from a string by writing
`"string".charAt(N)` (similar to how you get it's length with
`"s".length`). The returned value will be a string containing only one
character (for example `"b"`).

Write a function `countBs` that takes a string as its only argument
and returns a number that indicates the amount of uppercase “B”
characters in the string.

Next, change your function to be called `countChar`, and take a second
argument that indicates the character that is to be counted. Rewrite a
version of `countBs` on top of this new function.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
// Your code here.

console.log(countBs("BBC"));
// → 2
console.log(countChar("kakkerlak", "k"));
// → 4

endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

A loop in your function will have to take a look at all characters in
the string by running an index from zero to one below its length (`<
string.length`). When the character at the current position is the
same as the one it is looking for, it adds one to a counter variable.
Once the loop has finished, the counter can be returned.

Take care to make all the variables used in the function _local_ to
the function (by using the `var` keyword).
