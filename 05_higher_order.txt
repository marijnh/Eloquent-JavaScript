[quote, Master Yuan-Ma, The Book of Programming]
____
Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest
programs. 'Two-hundred thousand lines,' said Tzu-li, 'not counting
comments!' Tzu-ssu responded, 'Pssh, mine is almost a *million* lines
already.' Master Yuan-Ma said, 'My best program has five hundred
lines.' Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.

[quote, C.A.R. Hoare, 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture]
____
There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
deficiencies.
____

(((bug)))A large program is a costly program, and not just because
of the time it takes to build. Size almost always involves complexity,
and complexity confuses programmers. Confused programmers, in turn,
tend to introduce mistakes (_bugs_) into programs. A
large program also provides a lot of space for these bugs to hide,
making them hard to find.

Let us briefly go back to the final two example programs in the
introduction. The first is self-contained, and six lines long.

[source,javascript]
----
var total = 0, count = 1;
while (count <= 10) {
  total += count;
  count += 1;
}
console.log(total);
----

The second relies on two external functions, and is one line long.

[source,javascript]
----
console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
----

Which one is more likely to contain a bug?

If we count the size of the definitions of `sum` and `range`, the
second program is also big—even bigger than the first. But still, I'd
argue that it is more likely to be correct.

The reason it is more likely to be correct is that the solution is expressed
in a vocabulary that corresponds to the problem it is solving, and is thus
much more direct. Summing a range of numbers isn't about loops and counters, it
is about ranges and sums.

The definitions of this vocabulary (the functions `sum` and
`range`) will still involve loops, counters, and
other silly details. But because these building blocks are expressing simpler concepts
than the program as a whole, they are easier to get right.

== Abstraction ==

(((abstraction)))In the context of programming,
these kinds of vocabularies are usually called _abstractions_. Abstractions hide
details, and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract)
level.

(((recipe)))As an analogy, compare these two recipes for pea soup:

____
Put 1 cup of dried peas per person into a container. Add water until
the peas are well covered. Leave the peas in water for at least 12 hours.
Take the peas out of the water and put them in a cooking pan. Add 4
cups of water per person. Cover the pan and keep the peas
simmering for two hours. Take half an onion per person. Cut it into
pieces with a knife. Add it to the peas. Take a stalk of celery per
person. Cut it into pieces with a knife. Add it to the peas. Take a
carrot per person. Cut it into pieces. With a knife! Add it to the
peas. Cook for 10 more minutes.
____

And the second recipe:
____
Per person: 1 cup dried split peas, half a chopped onion, a stalk of
celery, and a carrot.

Soak peas for 12 hours. Simmer for 2 hours in 4 cups of water
(per person). Chop and add vegetables. Cook for 10 more minutes.
____

The second is shorter, and easier to interpret. It does rely on you
understanding a few more cooking-related words—“soak”, “simmer”,
“chop”, and, I guess, “vegetables”.

When programming, we can't rely on all the words we need to be
waiting for us in the
dictionary, so it's easy to fall into the pattern of the first
recipe—work out the precise steps the computer has to perform, one by
one, blind to the higher-level concepts that they express.

It has to become second nature, for a programmer, to notice when a
concept is begging to be abstracted into a new word.

== Abstracting array traversal ==

Plain functions, as we've seen them so far, are a good way to build
abstractions. But sometimes they fall short.

(((for loop)))In the previous chapter, this type of `for` loop made
several appearances:

[source,javascript]
----
var array = [1, 2, 3];
for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  var current = array[i];
  console.log(current);
}
----

It's trying to say: “For each element in the array, log it to the console”. But
it uses a very roundabout way that involves a counter variable `i`, a
check against the array's length, and an extra variable declaration to
pick out the current element. Apart from being a bit of an eyesore,
this provides a lot of space for potential mistakes. We might accidentally
reuse the `i` variable, or misspell `lenght`, or confuse the `i` and
`current` variables, and so on.

So let's try to abstract this into a function. Can you think
of a way?

Well, it's easy to write a function
that goes over an array and calls `console.log` on every element:

[source,javascript]
----
function logEach(array) {
  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
    console.log(array[i]);
}
----

(((array,traversal)))(((function,as value)))(((forEach method)))But
what if we want to do something other than logging the elements? Since
“doing something” can be represented as a function, and functions are
just values, we can pass our action as a function value:

[source,javascript]
----
function forEach(array, action) {
  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
    action(array[i]);
}

forEach(["Wampeter", "Foma", "Granfalloon"], console.log);
// → Wampeter
// → Foma
// → Granfalloon
----

Often, you don't pass a pre-defined function to `forEach`, but
create a function value on the spot instead.

[source,javascript]
----
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], sum = 0;
forEach(numbers, function(number) {
  sum += number;
});
console.log(sum);
// → 15
----

This looks quite a lot like the classical `for` loop, with its body
written as a block below it. Except that now the body is inside of the
function value, as well as inside of the parentheses of the call to
`forEach`. This is why it has to be
closed with the closing brace _and_ closing parenthesis.

In this pattern, we simply specify a variable name for
the current element (`number`), rather than having to
pick it out of the array manually.

In fact, we don't need to write `forEach` ourselves. It is available as a
standard method on arrays.
Since the array is already provided as the thing the method acts on,
`forEach` only takes one required argument: the function to be executed for each element.

To illustrate how helpful this is, remember this function
from the previous chapter that contains two array-traversing loops:

[source,javascript]
----
function gatherCorrelations(journal) {
  var phis = {};
  for (var entry = 0; entry < journal.length; ++entry) {
    var events = journal[entry].events;
    for (var i = 0; i < events.length; i++) {
      var event = events[i];
      if (!(event in phis))
        phis[event] = phi(tableFor(event, journal));
    }
  }
  return phis;
}
----

Working with `forEach` makes it slightly shorter and quite a bit cleaner:

[source,javascript]
----
function gatherCorrelations(journal) {
  var phis = {};
  journal.forEach(function(entry) {
    entry.events.forEach(function(event) {
      if (!(event in phis))
        phis[event] = phi(tableFor(event, journal));
    });
  });
  return phis;
}
----

== Higher-order functions ==

(((function,higher-order)))Functions that operate on other
functions, either by taking them as arguments or returning them, are called
_higher-order functions_. For JavaScript programmers used to the fact that
functions are regular values, there is nothing particularly remarkable
about the fact that such functions exist. The term comes from
mathematics, where the distinction between functions and other values
is taken a little more seriously.

Higher-order functions allow us to abstract over _actions_, not just
values. They come in several forms. For example, you can have functions that create
new functions:

[source,javascript]
----
function greaterThan(n) {
  return function(m) { return m > n; };
}
var greaterThan10 = greaterThan(10);
console.log(greaterThan10(11));
// → true
----

Or functions that change other functions:

[source,javascript]
----
function noisy(f) {
  return function(arg) {
    console.log("calling with", arg);
    var val = f(arg);
    console.log("called with", arg, "- got", val);
    return val;
  };
}
noisy(Boolean)(0);
// → calling with 0
// → called with 0 - got false
----

Or functions that implement custom types of control
flow:

[source,javascript]
----
function unless(test, then) {
  if (!test) then();
}
function repeat(times, body) {
  for (var i = 0; i < times; i++) body(i);
}

repeat(3, function(n) {
  unless(n % 2, function() {
    console.log(n, "is even");
  });
});
// → 0 is even
// → 2 is even
----

(((lexical scoping)))(((closure)))The lexical scoping rules that we
discussed in Chapter 3 work to our advantage when using
functions in this way. In the example above, the `n` variable is a
parameter to the outer function. Because the inner function lives
inside the environment of the outer one, it can use `n`. The
bodies of such inner functions can access the variables around them, and
play a role similar to the `{}` blocks used in regular loops
and conditional statements. An important difference is that variables
declared inside inner functions do not end up in the environment of the outer
function. And that is usually a good thing.

== Passing along arguments ==

The `noisy` function above, which wraps its argument in another
function, has a rather serious deficit.

[source,javascript]
----
function noisy(f) {
  return function(arg) {
    console.log("calling with", arg);
    var val = f(arg);
    console.log("called with", arg, "- got", val);
    return val;
  };
}
----

If `f` takes more than one parameter, only the first one is passed
through to it. We could add a bunch of arguments to the inner function
(`arg1`, `arg2`, and so on) and pass all of them to `f`, but it is unclear
how many would be necessary,
since different ++f++s might take different numbers of arguments.
This solution would also deprive `f` of the
information in `arguments.length`. Since we'd always pass the same
number of arguments, it wouldn't know how many argument were
originally given.

For these kinds of situations, JavaScript functions have an `apply`
method. The `apply` method gets passed an array (or array-like object) of
arguments, and will call the function with those arguments.

[source,javascript]
----
function transparentWrapping(f) {
  return function() {
    return f.apply(null, arguments);
  };
}
----

That's a particularly useless function, but it shows the pattern we
are interested in—the resulting function will pass all of the given
arguments, and only those arguments, to `f`. It does this by passing
its own `arguments` object to `apply`. The first argument to `apply`,
for which we are passing `null` here, can be used to simulate a method
call. More on that in the next chapter.

== JSON ==

(((array)))Higher-order functions that somehow apply a function to the
elements of an array are widely used in JavaScript. The `forEach`
method is the most primitive such function. There are a number of
other variants available as methods on arrays. In order to familiarize
ourselves with them, let's play around with another data set.

A few years ago, someone crawled through a lot of archives in order to
put together a book on the history of my family name
(“Haverbeke”—literally “Oatbrook”). I opened it hoping to find knights,
pirates, and alchemists ... but the book turns out to be mostly full of
Flemish farmers. For my amusement, I extracted the information on my
direct ancestors, and put it into a computer-readable format.

(((JSON)))The file I created looks something like this:

[source,application/json]
----
[
  {"name": "Emma de Milliano", "sex": "f",
   "born": 1876, "died": 1956,
   "father": "Petrus de Milliano",
   "mother": "Sophia van Damme"},
  {"name": "Carolus Haverbeke", "sex": "m",
   "born": 1832, "died": 1905,
   "father": "Carel Haverbeke",
   "mother": "Maria van Brussel"},
  … and so on
]
----

This format is called JSON (pronounced “Jason”), which stands for
JavaScript Object Notation. It is widely used as a data storage and
communication format on the Web.

JSON is very similar to JavaScript's way of writing arrays
and objects, with a few restrictions. All property names are
surrounded by quotes, and only simple data expressions—no function
calls, or variables, or anything that involves actual computation—are
allowed.

JavaScript provides two functions, `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`,
that convert data from and to this format. The first takes a JavaScript value,
and returns a JSON-encoded string. The second takes such a string, and converts
it to the value it encodes.

[source,javascript]
----
var string = JSON.stringify({name: "X", born: 1980});
console.log(string);
// → {"name":"X","born":1980}
console.log(JSON.parse(string).born);
// → 1980
----

The variable `ANCESTRY_FILE`, available in the sandbox for this
chapter as well as in
http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/ancestry.js[a downloadable file] on
the website!!tex  (`eloquentjavascript.net/code`)!!,
contains the content of my JSON file as a string. Let's decode it and
see how many people it contains:

// include_code strip_log

[source,javascript]
----
var ancestry = JSON.parse(ANCESTRY_FILE);
console.log(ancestry.length);
// → 39
----

== Filtering an array ==

To find the people in the ancestry data set that were young in
1924, the following function might be helpful. It filters out the
elements in an array that don't pass a test.

[source,javascript]
----
function filter(array, test) {
  var passed = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (test(array[i]))
      passed.push(array[i]);
  }
  return passed;
}

console.log(filter(ancestry, function(person) {
  return person.born > 1900 && person.born < 1925;
}));
// → [{name: "Philibert Haverbeke", …}, …]
----

This uses the argument named `test`, a function value, to fill in a
“gap” in the computation. The test function is called for each
element, and its return value determines whether an element is
included in the returned array or not.

Three people in the file were alive and young in 1924: my grandfather,
grandmother, and great-aunt.

Note how the `filter` function, rather than delete elements from the existing 
array, builds up a new array with only the elements that pass the test. This
function is _pure_, it does not modify the array it is given.

Like `forEach`, `filter` is also a standard method on arrays. The
example defined the function only in order to show what it does
internally. From now on, we'll use it like this instead:

[source,javascript]
----
console.log(ancestry.filter(function(person) {
  return person.father == "Carel Haverbeke";
}));
// → [{name: "Carolus Haverbeke", …}]
----

== Transforming with map ==

Say we have an array of objects representing people, produced by filtering the
`ancestry` array somehow. But we want an array of names, which is
easier to read through.

The `map` method transforms an array by applying a function to all of
its elements, and building a new array from the returned values. The
new array will have the same length as the input array, but its
content will have been “mapped” to a new form by the function.

// test: join

[source,javascript]
----
function map(array, transform) {
  var mapped = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
    mapped.push(transform(array[i]));
  return mapped;
}

var overNinety = ancestry.filter(function(person) {
  return person.died - person.born > 90;
});
console.log(map(overNinety, function(person) {
  return person.name;
}));
// → ["Clara Aernoudts", "Emile Haverbeke",
//    "Maria Haverbeke"]
----

Interestingly, the people that lived to over 90 years of age are the
same three people that we saw before—the people who were young in the
1920s, which happens to be the most recent generation in my data set. I
guess medicine has really come a long way.

Like `forEach` and `filter`, `map` is also a standard method on
arrays.

== Summarizing with reduce ==

Another common pattern of computation on arrays is computing a single
value from them. Our recurring example, summing a collection of
numbers, is an instance of this. Another example would be finding the person with
the earliest year of birth in the data set.

The higher-order operation that represents this pattern is called
_reduce_ (or sometimes _fold_). You can think of it as folding up the array, one
element at a time. When summing numbers, you'd start with the number zero, and
for each element, combine it with the current sum by adding the two.

The parameters to the `reduce` function are, apart from the array, a combining function
and a start value. The function is a little less straightforward than `filter` and `map`,
so pay careful attention.

[source,javascript]
----
function reduce(array, combine, start) {
  var current = start;
  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
    current = combine(current, array[i]);
  return current;
}

console.log(reduce([1, 2, 3, 4], function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}, 0));
// → 10
----

The standard array method `reduce`, which of course corresponds to
this function, has an additional convenience. If your array contains
at least one element, you are allowed to leave off the `start`
argument. The method will take the first element of the array as
its start value, and start reducing at the second element.

To use `reduce` to find my most ancient known ancestor, we can write
something like this:

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
console.log(ancestry.reduce(function(min, cur) {
  if (cur.born < min.born) return cur;
  else return min;
}));
// → {name: "Pauwels van Haverbeke", born: 1535, …}
----

== Composability ==

Let's back up for a moment and consider how we would have written the
previous example (finding the person with the earliest year of birth)
without higher-order functions. The code is not that much worse:

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
var min = ancestry[0];
for (var i = 1; i < ancestry.length; i++) {
  var cur = ancestry[i];
  if (cur.born < min.born)
    min = cur;
}
console.log(min);
// → {name: "Pauwels van Haverbeke", born: 1535, …}
----

There are a few more variables, and the
program is two lines longer, but still quite easy to understand.

The higher-order function approach really starts to shine when you
start _composing_ functions, or chaining them together. As an example, let us write code
that finds the average age for men and for women in the data set.

// test: clip

[source,javascript]
----
function average(array) {
  function plus(a, b) { return a + b; }
  return array.reduce(plus) / array.length;
}
function age(p) { return p.died - p.born; }
function male(p) { return p.sex == "m"; }
function female(p) { return p.sex == "f"; }

console.log(average(ancestry.filter(male).map(age)));
// → 61.67
console.log(average(ancestry.filter(female).map(age)));
// → 54.56
----

(It's a bit silly that we have to define `plus` as a function, but
operators in JavaScript, unlike functions, are not values, so we can't
pass them as arguments.)

Instead of tangling all of the logic into a big loop, we can
neatly decompose it into the concepts we are interested in—determining
sex, computing age, averaging numbers—and apply them one by one
to get the result we were looking for.

This is _fabulous_ for writing clear code. Unfortunately, this clarity comes at a cost.

== The cost ==

In the happy land of elegant code and pretty rainbows, there lives a
spoil-sport monster called “__inefficiency__”.

It's easy to think about processing an array as a sequence of cleanly
separated steps that each do something with the array and produce a
new array. But building up all those
intermediate arrays is somewhat expensive.

Likewise, passing a function to `forEach` and letting that method handle the
array iteration for us is convenient and elegant. But function calls
in JavaScript are costly compared to simple loop bodies.

And so it goes with a lot of techniques that help improve the clarity
of a program. Abstractions add layers between the raw things the
computer is doing and the concepts we are working with, and thus cause
the machine to perform more work. This is not an iron
law—there are programming languages that have better support for
building abstractions without adding inefficiencies, and even in
JavaScript, an experienced programmer can find ways to write
relatively abstract code that is still fast—but it is a problem that
comes up a lot.

Fortunately, most computers are insanely fast, and if you are
processing a modest set of data, or doing something that only has to
happen on a human time scale (say, every time the
user clicks a button), then it _does not matter_ whether you wrote a
pretty solution that takes half a millisecond, or a super-optimized
solution that takes a tenth of a millisecond.

It is helpful to roughly keep track of how often a piece of your
program is going to run. If you have a loop inside a loop (either directly,
or through the outer loop calling a function that ends up performing
the inner loop), the code inside the inner loop will end up running
__N__×__M__ times, where _N_ is the number of times the outer loop repeats, and
_M_ the number of times the inner loop repeats within each iteration of the outer loop. If that inner loop
contains another loop that makes _P_ rounds, its body will run __M__×__N__×__P__
times, and so on. This can add up to large numbers quite quickly, and when a program is
slow, the problem can often be traced to only a small part of the code, which
sits in such an inner loop.

== Great-great-great-great-... ==

My grandfather, Philibert Haverbeke, is included in the data file. By starting
with him, I can trace my lineage to find out whether the most ancient
person in the data, Pauwels van Haverbeke, is my direct ancestor.
And if he is, I would like to know how much DNA I theoretically share with him.

To be able to go from a parent's name to the actual object that
represents this person, we first build up an object that associates
names with people.

// include_code strip_log

[source,javascript]
----
var byName = {};
ancestry.forEach(function(person) {
  byName[person.name] = person;
});

console.log(byName["Philibert Haverbeke"]);
// → {name: "Philibert Haverbeke", …}
----

Now, the problem is not entirely as simple as following the `father`
properties and counting how many we need to reach Pauwels. There are
several cases in the family tree where people married their second
cousins (tiny villages and all that). This causes the branches of the
family tree to re-join in a few places, which means I share more than
1/2^_G_^ of my genes with this person, where _G_ for the number of
generations between Pauwels and me. This formula comes from the idea that
each generation splits the gene pool in two.

A reasonable way to think about this problem is to look at it as being
analogous to `reduce`, which condenses an array down to a
single value by repeatedly combining values, left to right. In
this case, we also want to condense our data structure down to a
single value, but in a way that follows family lines. The _shape_ of
the data is that of a family tree, rather than a flat list.

The way we want to reduce this shape is by computing a value for a
given person by combining values from their ancestors. This can be
done recursively: if we are interested in person _A_, we have to
compute the values for __A__’s parents, which in turn requires us to
compute the value for __A__’s grandparents, and so on. In principle,
that'd require us to look at an infinite number of people, but since
our data set is finite, we have to stop somewhere. We'll allow a
default value to be given to our reduction function, which will be
used for people that are not in the data. In our case,
that value is simply zero, on the assumption that people not in the
list don't share DNA with the ancestor we are looking at.

Given a person, a function to combine values from the two parents of a
given person, and a default value, `reduceAncestors` condenses a value
from a family tree.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function reduceAncestors(person, f, defaultValue) {
  function valueFor(person) {
    if (person == null)
      return defaultValue;
    else
      return f(person, valueFor(byName[person.mother]),
                       valueFor(byName[person.father]));
  }
  return valueFor(person);
}
----

The inner function (`valueFor`) handles a single person. Through the
magic of recursion, it can simply call itself to handle the father and
the mother of this person. The results, along with the person object
itself, are passed to `f`, which returns the actual value for this
person.

We can then use this to compute the amount of DNA my grandfather
shared with Pauwels van Haverbeke, and divide that by four.

// test: clip

[source,javascript]
----
function sharedDNA(person, fromMother, fromFather) {
  if (person.name == "Pauwels van Haverbeke")
    return 1;
  else
    return (fromMother + fromFather) / 2;
}
var ph = byName["Philibert Haverbeke"];
console.log(reduceAncestors(ph, sharedDNA, 0) / 4);
// → 0.00049
----

The person with the name Pauwels van Haverbeke obviously shared 100%
of his DNA with Pauwels van Haverbeke (there are no people who share
names in the data set), so the function returns 1 for him. All other
people share the average of the amounts that their parents share.

So, statistically speaking, I share about 0.05% of my DNA with this
16th-century person. It should be noted that this is only a
statistical approximation, not an exact amount. It is a rather small
number, but given how much genetic material we carry (about 3 billion
base pairs), there's still probably some aspect, in the biological
machine that is me, that originates with Pauwels.

We could also have computed this number without relying on
`reduceAncestors`. But separating the general approach (condensing a
family tree) from the specific case (computing shared DNA) can improve
the clarity of the code, and allows us to reuse the abstract part of
the program for other cases. For example, the following code finds the percentage of
known ancestors, for a given person, that lived past 70:

// test: clip

[source,javascript]
----
function countAncestors(person, test) {
  function combine(person, fromMother, fromFather) {
    var thisOneCounts = test(person);
    return fromMother + fromFather + (thisOneCounts ? 1 : 0);
  }
  return reduceAncestors(person, combine, 0);
}
function longLivingPercentage(person) {
  var all = countAncestors(person, function(person) {
    return true;
  });
  var longLiving = countAncestors(person, function(person) {
    return (person.died - person.born) >= 70;
  });
  return longLiving / all;
}
console.log(longLivingPercentage(byName["Emile Haverbeke"]));
// → 0.145
----

Such numbers are not to be taken too seriously, given the fact that
our data set contains a rather arbitrary collection of people. But the
code illustrates the fact that `reduceAncestors` gives us a useful
piece of vocabulary for working with the family tree data
structure.

== Binding ==

(((bind method)))(((partial application)))The `bind` method, which all
functions have, creates a new function that will call the original
function, but with some of the arguments already fixed.

The code below shows an example of `bind` in use. First it defines
a function `isInSet` that tells us whether a person is in a given set of strings.
To call `filter` in order to collect those person objects whose names
are in a specific set, we can either write a function expression that
makes a call to `isInSet` with our set as its first argument, or
_partially apply_ the `isInSet` function.

[source,javascript]
----
var theSet = ["Carel Haverbeke", "Maria van Brussel",
              "Donald Duck"];
function isInSet(set, person) {
  return set.indexOf(person.name) > -1;
}

console.log(ancestry.filter(function(person) {
  return isInSet(theSet, person);
}));
// → [{name: "Maria van Brussel", …},
//    {name: "Carel Haverbeke", …}]
console.log(ancestry.filter(isInSet.bind(null, theSet)));
// → … same result
----

The above `bind` call returns a function that will call
`isInSet` with `theSet` as first argument, followed by any remaining
arguments given to the bound function.

The first argument, where the example passes `null`, is used for
method calls, similar to the first argument to `apply`.
We'll describe this in more detail in the next chapter.

== Summary ==

Being able to pass function values to other functions is not just a
gimmick, but a deeply useful aspect of JavaScript. It allows us to
write computations with “gaps” in them as functions, and have the
code that calls these functions to fill in those gaps by providing
function values to describe the missing computations.

Arrays provide a number of very useful higher-order methods—`forEach`
to do something with each element in an array, `filter` to build a new array with some elements filtered out, `map` to build a new
array where each element has been put through a function, and `reduce`
to combine all an array's elements into a single value.

Functions have an `apply` method that can be used to call them with an
array specifying their arguments. They also have a `bind` method,
which is used to create a partially applied version of the function.

== Exercises ==

=== Flattening ===

Use the `reduce` method in combination with the `concat` method to
“flatten” an array of arrays into a single array that has all the
elements of the input arrays.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
var arrays = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]];
// Your code here.
// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

=== Mother-child age difference ===

Using the example data set from this chapter, compute the average age
difference between mothers and children. You can use the `average`
function defined earlier in this chapter.

Note that not all the mothers mentioned in the data are themselves
present in the array. The `byName` object, which makes it easy to find
a person's object from their name, might be useful here.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no
// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function average(array) {
  function plus(a, b) { return a + b; }
  return array.reduce(plus) / array.length;
}

var byName = {};
ancestry.forEach(function(person) {
  byName[person.name] = person;
});

// Your code here.

// → 31.2
----
endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

Because not all elements in the `ancestry` array produce useful data
(we can't compute the age difference unless we know the birth date of
the mother), we will have to apply `filter` in some manner before
calling `average`. You could do it as a first pass, by defining a
`hasKnownMother` function and filtering on that first. Alternatively,
you could start by calling `map`, and in your mapping function return
either the age difference, or `null` if no mother is known. Then, you
can call `filter` to remove the `null` elements before passing the
array to `average`.

!!solution!!

=== Historical life expectancy ===

When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than
ninety years, only the very latest generation in the data came out.
Let us take a closer look at that phenomenon.

Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data
set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their
year of death, dividing it by a hundred, and rounding it up, as in
`Math.ceil(person.died / 100)`.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
function average(array) {
  function plus(a, b) { return a + b; }
  return array.reduce(plus) / array.length;
}

// Your code here.

// → 16: 43.5
//   17: 51.2
//   18: 52.8
//   19: 54.8
//   20: 84.7
//   21: 94
----
endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

The essence of this example lies in grouping the elements of a
collection by some aspect of theirs—splitting the array of ancestors
into smaller arrays with the ancestors for each century.

During the grouping process, keep an object that associates century
names (numbers) with arrays of either person objects or ages. Since we
do not know in advance what categories we will find, we'll have to
create them on the fly. For each person, after computing their
century, we test whether that century was already known. If not, add
an array for it. Then add the person (or age) to the array for the
proper century.

Finally, a `for`/`in` loop can be used to print the average ages for
the individual centuries.

!!solution!!

For bonus points, write a function `groupBy` that abstracts the
grouping operation. It should accept as arguments an array and a function
that computes the group for an element in the array, and returns the
object containing the groups.

=== Every and then some ===

Arrays also come with the standard methods `every` and `some`. 
Both take a predicate function that, when called with an array element
as argument, returns true or false. Just like `&&` only returns a true
value when the expressions on both sides are true, `every` only
returns true when the predicate returned true for _all_ elements
of the array. Similarly, `some` returns true as soon as the predicate
returned true for _any_ of the elements. They do not process more
elements than necessary—for example, if `some` finds that the
predicate holds for the first element of the array, it will not look
at the values after that.

Write two functions, `every` and `some`, that behave like these
methods, except that they take the array as their first argument,
rather than being a method.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
// Your code here.

console.log(every([NaN, NaN, NaN], isNaN));
// → true
console.log(every([NaN, NaN, 4], isNaN));
// → false
console.log(some([NaN, 3, 4], isNaN));
// → true
console.log(some([2, 3, 4], isNaN));
// → false
----
endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

The functions can follow a similar pattern to the definition of
`forEach` at the start of the chapter, except that they must return
immediately (with the right value) when the predicate function returns
false—or true. Don't forget to put another `return` statement after
the loop, so that the function also returns the correct value when it
reaches the end of the array.

!!solution!!
