= Project: A Paint Program =

The material from the previous chapters gives you all the elements you
need to build simple web applications. In this chapter, we will do
just that, and create a simple drawing program.

We will take some of our inspiration from _Paint_, the drawing program
that comes bundled with Microsoft Windows. This is a program that
allows you to open image files, scribble on them, and then save them
again. To keep the size of the chapter within reasonable bounds, the
application created here will be even simpler than Paint.

This is what it will look like:

image::img/paint.png[alt="A simple paint program"]

(Something about computer painting seems to invite this kind of
talentless smearing.)

== Implementation ==

The interface for the paint program is made up of a big `<canvas>`
element on top, with a number of form fields below it. The user draws
on the picture by selecting a tool from a `<select>` field, and then
clicking the canvas. There are tools for drawing lines, erasing parts
of the picture, adding text, and so on.

Clicking on the canvas will hand off the `"mousedown"` event to the
currently selected tool, which can handle it in whichever way it
chooses. The line drawing tool, as an example, will listen for
`"mousemove"` events until the mouse button is released, and draw
lines along the mouse's path using the current color and brush size.

Color and brush size are selected with additional form fields. These
are hooked up to update the canvas drawing context's `fillStyle`,
`strokeStyle`, and `lineWidth` whenever they are changed.

Loading an image into the program can be done in two ways. The first
uses a file field, where the user can select a file on their hard
disk. The second asks for a URL, and will fetch an image from the web.

Saving an image is done in a somewhat atypical way. The “save” link at
the right-hand side points at the current image. It can be followed,
shared, or saved. I will explain how this is achieved in a moment.

== Building up the DOM ==

Our program's interface is built out of over 30 DOM elements. We need
to construct these somehow.

HTML is the most obvious format for defining complex DOM structures.
But separating the program into a piece of HTML and a script is made
difficult by the fact that many of the DOM elements need event
handlers, or have to be touched by the script in some other way. Thus,
our script would have to make lots of `querySelector` (or similar)
calls in order to find the DOM elements that it needs to act on.

It would be nice if the DOM structure for each part of our interface
is defined close to the JavaScript code that drives it. Thus, I've
opted to do all creation of DOM nodes in JavaScript. As we saw in
link:13_dom.html#standard[Chapter 13], the built-in interface for
building up a DOM structure is horrendously verbose. Thus, if we are
going to do a lot of DOM construction, we need some kind of helper
function.

This is an extended version of the `elt` function from link:13_dom.html#elt[Chapter 13]. It
creates an element with the given name and attributes, and appends all
further arguments it gets as child nodes, automatically converting
strings to text nodes.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
function elt(name, attributes) {
  var node = document.createElement(name);
  if (attributes) {
    for (var attr in attributes)
      if (attributes.hasOwnProperty(attr))
        node.setAttribute(attr, attributes[attr]);
  }
  for (var i = 2; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    var child = arguments[i];
    if (typeof child == "string")
      child = document.createTextNode(child);
    node.appendChild(child);
  }
  return node;
}
----

This allows us to create elements easily, without making our source
code as long and dull as a corporate end-user agreement.

== The foundation ==

The core of our program is the `createPaint` function, which appends
the paint interface to the DOM element it is given as argument.
Because we want to build our program piece by piece, we will use an
object `controls` that holds functions that initialize the various
controls below the image.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
var controls = Object.create(null);

function createPaint(parent) {
  var canvas = elt("canvas", {width: 500, height: 300});
  var cx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  var toolbar = elt("div", {class: "toolbar"});
  for (var name in controls)
    toolbar.appendChild(controls[name](cx));

  var panel = elt("div", {class: "picturepanel"}, canvas);
  parent.appendChild(elt("div", null, panel, toolbar));
}                         
----

Each control has access to the canvas drawing context (and, through
that context's `canvas` property, to the `<canvas>` element itself).
Most of the program's state lives in this canvas—it contains the
current picture as well as the selected color and brush size.

We wrap the canvas and the controls in `<div>` elements with classes
to be able to add some styling, for example the grey border around the
picture.

== Tool selection ==

The first control we add is the the `<select>` element that allows the
user to pick a drawing tool. Again, we will use an object to collect
the various tools, so that we do not have to hard-code them all in one
place, and so that we can add more tools later. This object associates
the names of the tools with the function that should be called when
they are selected and the canvas is clicked.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
var tools = Object.create(null);

controls.tool = function(cx) {
  var select = elt("select");
  for (var name in tools)
    select.appendChild(elt("option", null, name));

  cx.canvas.addEventListener("mousedown", function(event) {
    if (event.which == 1) {
      tools[select.value](event, cx);
      event.preventDefault();
    }
  });

  return elt("span", null, "Tool: ", select);
};
----

The tool field is populated with `<option>` elements for all tools
that have been defined, and a `"mousedown"` handler on the canvas
element takes care of calling the function for the current tool,
passing it both the event object and the drawing context as arguments.
It also calls `preventDefault`, so that holding the mouse button and
dragging does not cause the browser to select parts of the page.

The most basic tool is the line tool, which allows the user to draw
lines with the mouse. To be able to put the line ends in the right
place, we need to be able to find the canvas-relative coordinates that
a given mouse event corresponds to. The `getBoundingClientRect`
method, briefly mentioned in link:13_dom.html#boundingRect[Chapter 13], can help us here. It tells us
where an element is shown, relative to the top left corner of the
screen. The `clientX` and `clientY` properties on mouse events are
also relative to this corner, so we can subtract the top left corner
of the canvas from them to get a position relative to that corner.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
function relativePos(event, element) {
  var rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();
  return {x: Math.floor(event.clientX - rect.left),
          y: Math.floor(event.clientY - rect.top)};
}
----

Several of the drawing tools need to listen for `"mousemove"` events
as long as the mouse button is held down. The `trackDrag` function
takes care of the event registration and unregistration for such
situations. It takes two arguments, a function to call for each
`"mousemove"` event and a function to call when the mouse button is
released again. Either argument can be omitted when it is not needed.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
function trackDrag(onMove, onEnd) {
  function end(event) {
    removeEventListener("mousemove", onMove);
    removeEventListener("mouseup", end);
    if (onEnd)
      onEnd(event);
  }
  addEventListener("mousemove", onMove);
  addEventListener("mouseup", end);
}
----

The “line” tool uses these two helpers to do actual drawing.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
tools.Line = function(event, cx, onEnd) {
  cx.lineCap = "round";

  var pos = relativePos(event, cx.canvas);
  trackDrag(function(event) {
    cx.beginPath();
    cx.moveTo(pos.x, pos.y);
    pos = relativePos(event, cx.canvas);
    cx.lineTo(pos.x, pos.y);
    cx.stroke();
  }, onEnd);
};
----

It starts by setting the drawing context's `lineCap` property to
`"round"`, which has the effect that both ends of a stroked path will
be round, rather than the square form that is the default behavior.
This is a trick to make sure that multiple separate lines, drawn in
response to separate events, do look like a single, coherent line.
With bigger line widths, you will see gaps at corners if you remove
this line.

Then, for every `"mousemove"` event that occurs as long as the mouse
button is down, a simple line segment is drawn between the mouse's old
and new position, using whatever `strokeStyle` and `lineWidth` happen
to be currently defined.

The `onEnd` argument to `tools.Line` is simply passed through to
`trackDrag`. The normal way to run tools won't pass a third argument,
so when using the line tool, that argument will hold `undefined`, and
nothing happens at the end of the mouse drag. The argument is there to
allow us to implement the “erase” tool on top of the “line” tool with
very little additional code.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
tools.Erase = function(event, cx) {
  cx.globalCompositeOperation = "destination-out";
  tools.Line(event, cx, function() {
    cx.globalCompositeOperation = "source-over";
  });
};
----

The `globalCompositeOperation` property influences the way drawing
operations on a canvas influence the color of the pixels they touch.
By default it is `"source-over"`, which means that the drawn color is
overlaid on the existing color at that spot. If it is an opaque color,
it will simply replace the old color, but if it is partially
transparent, the two will be mixed.

The “erase” tool sets `globalCompositeOperation` to
`"destination-out"`, which has the effect of erasing the pixels we
touch, making them transparent again.

That gives us two tools. The program so far is a working paint
program, allows us to draw black lines a single pixel wide (the
default `strokeStyle` and `lineWidth` for a canvas), and erase them
again.

== Color and brush size ==

Assuming that users will want to draw in colors other than black, and
use different brush sizes, let's add controls for those two settings.

In link:18_forms.html#forms[Chapter 18], I discussed a number of different form fields. Color
fields were not among those. Traditionally, browsers do not have
built-in support for color pickers, but in the past years, a number of
new form field types have been standardized. One of those is `<input
type="color">`. Others include `"date"`, `"email"`, `"url"`, and
`"number"`. Not all browsers support them yet—at the time of writing,
no version of Internet Explorer version supports color fields. The
default type of an `<input>` tag is `"text"`, and when an unsupported
type is found, browsers will treat it as a text field. That means that
Internet Explorer users running our paint program will have to type in
the name of the color they want, rather than select it from a
convenient widget.(!tex  This is what it may look like:!)

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/form_multi_select.png[alt="A multiple select field",width="5cm"]

endif::tex_target[]

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
controls.color = function(cx) {
  var input = elt("input", {type: "color"});
  input.addEventListener("change", function() {
    cx.fillStyle = input.value;
    cx.strokeStyle = input.value;
  });
  return elt("span", null, "Color: ", input);
};
----

Whenever the value of the color field changes, the drawing context's
`fillStyle` and `strokeStyle` are updated to hold the new value.

The field for configuring the brush size works similarly.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
controls.brushSize = function(cx) {
  var select = elt("select");
  var sizes = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 25, 35, 50, 75, 100];
  sizes.forEach(function(size) {
    select.appendChild(elt("option", {value: size},
                           size + " pixels"));
  });
  select.addEventListener("change", function() {
    cx.lineWidth = select.value;
  });
  return elt("span", null, "Brush size: ", select);
};
----

It generates options from an array of brush sizes, and again ensures
that the canvas' `lineWidth` corresponds to the selected size.

== Saving ==

To explain the implementation of the “save” link, I must first tell
you about _data URLs_. A data URL is a URL whose protocol is _data:_.
Unlike regular _http:_ and _https:_ URLs, data URLs do not point at a
resource, but contain the entire resource inside of them. This is a
data URL containing a very simple HTML document:

----
data:text/html,<h1 style="color:red">Hello!</h1>
----

Such URLs are useful for various things, such as including small
images directly in a style sheet file. They also allow us to link to
things that we created on the client side, in the browser, without
first moving them to some server.

Canvas elements have a convenient method `toDataURL`, which will
return a data URL that contains the picture on the canvas as an image
file. We don't want to update our “save” link every time the picture
is changed, since for big pictures this involves moving quite a lot of
data into a link, and would be noticeably slow. Instead, we rig the
link to update its `href` attribute whenever it is focused (with the
keyboard) or the mouse is moved over it.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
controls.save = function(cx) {
  var link = elt("a", {href: "/"}, "Save");
  function update() {
    try {
      link.href = cx.canvas.toDataURL();
    } catch (e) {
      if (e instanceof SecurityError)
        link.href = "javascript:alert(" +
          JSON.stringify("Can't save: " + e.toString()) + ")";
      else
        throw e;
    }
  }
  link.addEventListener("mouseover", update);
  link.addEventListener("focus", update);
  return link;
};
----

(((magic)))Thus, the link just quietly sits there, pointing at the
wrong thing, but when the use approaches it, it magically updates
itself to point at the current picture.

If you load a very big image, some browsers will choke on the giant
data URLs that this produces. But for small pictures, this should work
well.

Here we may once again run into the subtleties of a browser's
sandboxing. When an image is loaded from a URL on another domain, and
the server's response did not include a header that tells the browser
that this resource may be used from other domains (see
link:17_http.html#http_sandbox[Chapter 17]), the canvas now contains
information that the _user_ may look at, but that the _script_ may
not. The reason for this is that we may have requested a picture that
contains private information (for example, a graph showing the user's
bank account balance), using the user's session. If scripts could get
information out of that picture, they could snoop on the user in
undesirable ways.

To prevent these kinds of information leaks, browsers will marks a
canvas as _tainted_ when an image that the script may not see is drawn
onto it. Pixel data, including data URLs, may not be extracted from a
tainted canvas. It is write-only, so to say.

This is why we need the `try`/`catch` statement in the `update`
function for the “save” link. When the canvas has become tainted,
calling `toDataURL` will raise an exception that is an instance of
`SecurityError`. When that happens we set the link to point at yet
another kind of URL, using the _javascript:_ protocol. Such links
simply execute the script given after the colon when they are
followed, so the link will show an `alert` window informing the user
of the problem when it is clicked.

== Loading image files ==

The final two controls are used to load images, from local files and
from URLs. We'll need the following helper function, which tries to
load an image file from a URL and replace the contents of the canvas
with it.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
function loadImageURL(cx, url) {
  var image = document.createElement("img");
  image.addEventListener("load", function() {
    var color = cx.fillStyle, size = cx.lineWidth;
    cx.canvas.width = image.width;
    cx.canvas.height = image.height;
    cx.drawImage(image, 0, 0);
    cx.fillStyle = color;
    cx.strokeStyle = color;
    cx.lineWidth = size;
  });
  image.src = url;
}
----

We want to change the size of the canvas to precisely fit the image.
For some reason, changing the size of a canvas will cause its drawing
context to forget configuration properties like `fillStyle` and
`lineWidth`, so the function first saves those, and restores them
after it has updated the size.

The control for loading a local file uses the `FileReader` technique
from link:18_forms.html#filereader[Chapter 18]. Apart from the
`readAsText` method we used there, such reader objects also have a
method `readAsDataURL`, which is exactly what we need here. We load
the file that the user chose as a data URL, and pass it to
`loadImageURL` to put it into the canvas.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
controls.openFile = function(cx) {
  var input = elt("input", {type: "file"});
  input.addEventListener("change", function() {
    if (input.files.length == 0) return;
    var reader = new FileReader();
    reader.addEventListener("load", function() {
      loadImageURL(cx, reader.result);
    });
    reader.readAsDataURL(input.files[0]);
  });
  return elt("div", null, "Open file: ", input);
};
----

Loading a file from a URL is even simpler. But with a text field, it
is less clear when the user has finished writing the URL, so we can't
simply listen for `"change"` events. Instead, we will wrap the field
in a form, and respond when the form is submitted, either because the
user pressed Enter or because they pressed the “load” button.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
controls.openURL = function(cx) {
  var input = elt("input", {type: "text"});
  var form = elt("form", null,
                 "Open URL: ", input,
                 elt("button", {type: "submit"}, "load"));
  form.addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    loadImageURL(cx, form.querySelector("input").value);
  });
  return form;
};
----

We have now defined all the controls that our simple paint program
needs. But it could use a few more tools.

== Finishing up ==

It is very easy to add a text tool, which uses `prompt` to ask the
user which string it should draw.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
tools.Text = function(event, cx) {
  var text = prompt("Text:", "");
  if (text) {
    var pos = relativePos(event, cx.canvas);
    cx.font = Math.max(7, cx.lineWidth) + "px sans-serif";
    cx.fillText(text, pos.x, pos.y);
  }
};
----

It would be possible to add extra fields for the font size and the
font, but for simplicity's sake we always use a sans-serif font, and
base the font size on the current brush size, with a minimum size of 7
pixels, because text smaller than that is unlikely to be readable.

Another indispensable tool for drawing amateurish computer graphics is
the “spray paint” tool. This one draws dots in random locations under
the brush as long as the mouse is held down, allowing denser or less
dense speckling to be created by moving the mouse faster or slower.

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
tools.Spray = function(event, cx) {
  var radius = cx.lineWidth / 2;
  var area = radius * radius * Math.PI;
  var dotsPerTick = Math.ceil(area / 30);

  var currentPos = relativePos(event, cx.canvas);
  var spray = setInterval(function() {
    for (var i = 0; i < dotsPerTick; i++) {
      var offset = randomPointInRadius(radius);
      cx.fillRect(currentPos.x + offset.x,
                  currentPos.y + offset.y, 1, 1);
    }
  }, 25);
  trackDrag(function(event) {
    currentPos = relativePos(event, cx.canvas);
  }, function() {
    clearInterval(spray);
  });
};
----

The tool uses `setInterval` to spit out colored dots every 25
milliseconds as long as the mouse button is held down. The
`trackDrag` function is used to keep `currentPos` pointing at the
current mouse position, and to turn off the interval when the mouse
button is released.

To determine how many dots to draw every time the interval fires, the
function computes the area of the current brush, and divides that by
30. To find a random position under the brush, the following function
is used:

// include_code

[sandbox="paint"]
[source,javascript]
----
function randomPointInRadius(radius) {
  for (;;) {
    var x = Math.random() * 2 - 1;
    var y = Math.random() * 2 - 1;
    if (x * x + y * y <= 1)
      return {x: x * radius, y: y * radius};
  }
}
----

This generates points in the square between (-1,-1) and (1,1), and as
soon as it finds one that lies within a circle with radius 1 (using
the Pythagorean theorem), it returns it, multiplied by the `radius`
argument.

The loop is necessary because the straightforward way of generating a
random point within a circle, by using a random angle and distance,
and calling `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` to create the corresponding
point, the dots are not distributed uniformly, but more likely to
appear near the center of the circle. There are ways around this, but
they are more complicated than the loop above.

We now have a functioning paint program.(!html  Run the code below to
try it out.!)

== Exercises ==

There is still plenty of room for improvement. Let's add a few more
pieces of functionality as exercises.

=== Rectangles ===

Define a tool called `Rectangle` that fills a rectangle (see the
`fillRect` method from link:16_canvas.html#fill_stroke[Chapter 16]) with the current color. The
rectangle should span from the point where the user pressed the mouse
button to the point where they released it. Note that the latter might
be above or to the left of the former.

Once it works, you'll notice that it is somewhat jarring to not see
the the rectangle as you are dragging the mouse to select its size.
Can you come up with a way to show some kind of rectangle during the
dragging, without actually drawing to the canvas until the mouse
button is released?

If nothing comes to mind, think back to the `position: absolute` style
which was discussed in link:13_dom.html#animation[Chapter 13], which can be used to overlay a node
on the rest of the document. The `pageX` and `pageY` properties of a
mouse event can be used to position an element precisely under the
mouse, by setting the `left`, `top`, `width`, and `height` styles to
the correct pixel values.

!!solution!!

You can use `relativePos` to find the corner corresponding to the
start of the mouse drag. Figuring out where the drag ends can be done
with `trackDrag`, or by registering your own event handler.

When you have two corners of the rectangle, you must somehow translate
these into the arguments that `fillRect` expects: the top left corner,
width, and height of the rectangle. `Math.min` can be used to find the
leftmost x coordinate and topmost y coordinate. To get the width or
height, you can call `Math.abs` (the absolute value) on the difference
between two sides.

Showing the rectangle during the mouse drag requires a similar set
numbers, but in the context of the whole page, rather than relative to
the canvas. Consider writing a function `findRect`, which converts two
points into an object with `top`, `left`, `width`, and `height`
properties, so that you don't have to write the same logic twice.

You can then create a `<div>` node, and set its `style.position` to
`absolute`. When setting positioning styles, do not forget to append
`"px"` to the numbers. The node must be added to the document (you can
append it to `document.body`), and also removed again when the drag
ends and the actual rectangle gets drawn onto the canvas.

!!solution!!

=== Color picker ===

Another tool that is commonly found in graphics programs is a color
picker, which allows the user to click on the picture, and selects the
color under the mouse pointer. Build this.

In order to build this, we need a way to access the content of the
canvas. The `toDataURL` method more or less did this, but getting
pixel information out of such a data URL is hard. Instead, we'll use
the `getImageData` method on the drawing context, which returns a
rectangular piece of the image as an object with `width`, `height`,
and `data` properties. The `data` property holds an array of numbers
from 0 to 255, using four numbers to represent each pixel's red,
green, blue, and alpha (opaqueness) components.

This example retrieves the numbers for a single pixel from a canvas,
once when the canvas is blank (all pixels are transparent black), and
once when the pixel has been colored red.

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
function pixelAt(cx, x, y) {
  var data = cx.getImageData(x, y, 1, 1);
  console.log(data.data);
}

var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
var cx = canvas.getContext("2d");
pixelAt(cx, 10, 10);
// → [0, 0, 0, 0]

cx.fillStyle = "red";
cx.fillRect(10, 10, 1, 1);
pixelAt(cx, 10, 10);
// → [255, 0, 0, 255]
----

The arguments to `getImageData` indicate the starting x and y
coordinates of the rectangle we want to retrieve, followed by its
width and height.

Ignore transparency during this exercise, and look only at the first
three values for a given pixel. Also do not worry about updating the
color field when the user picks a color. Just make sure that the
drawing context's `fillStyle` and `strokeStyle` get set to the color
under the mouse cursor.

Remember that these properties accept any color that CSS understand,
which includes the `rgb(R, G, B)` style we saw in link:15_game.html#game_css[Chapter 15].

The `getImageData` method is subject to the same restrictions as
++toDataURL++—it will raise an error when the canvas contains pixels
that originate from another domain. Use a `try`/`catch` statement to
report such errors with an `alert` dialog.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,text/html]
----
<script>
  tools["Pick color"] = function(event, cx) {
    // Your code here.
  };
</script>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/paint.css">
<body>
  <script>createPaint(document.body);</script>
</body>
----

endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

You'll again need to use `relativePos` to find out which pixel. The
`pixelAt` function in the example demonstrates how to get the values
for a given pixel. Putting those into an `rgb` string merely requires
some string concatenation.

Make sure you verify that the exception you catch is an instance of

=== Flood fill ===

This is a more advanced exercise than the preceding two, and will
require you to design a non-trivial solution to a tricky problem. Make
sure you have plenty of time and patience before starting to work on
this exercise, and do not get discouraged by initial failures.

A “flood fill” tool colors the pixel under the mouse, and the whole
group of pixels around it that have the same color. For the purpose of
this exercise, we will consider such a group to include all pixels
that can be reached from our starting pixel by moving in single-pixel
horizontal and vertical steps (not diagonal), without ever touching a
pixel that has a color different form the starting pixel.

The picture below illustrates the set of pixels colored when the flood
fill tool is used at the marked pixel:

image::img/flood-grid.svg[alt="Flood fill example",width="6cm"]

The flood fill does not leak through diagonal gaps, and does not touch
pixels that are not reachable, even if they have the same color as the
target pixel.

You will once again need `getImageData` to find out the color for each
pixel. It is probably a good idea to fetch the whole image in one go,
and then pick out pixel data from the resulting array. The pixels are
organized in this array in a similar way to the grid elements in
link:07_elife.html#grid[Chapter 7], one row at a time, except that each pixel is represented by
four values. The first value for the pixel at (x,y) is at position (x
+ y × width) × 4.

Do include the fourth (alpha) value this time, since we want to be
able to tell the difference between empty and black pixels.

Finding all adjacent pixels with the same color requires you to “walk”
over the pixel surface, one pixel up, down, left, or right, as long as
new same-colored pixels can be found. But you won't find all pixels in
a group on the first walk. Rather, you have to do something similar to
the backtracking described in link:09_regexp.html#backtracking[Chapter
9], as done by the regular expression matcher. Whenever more than one
possible direction to proceed is seen, you must store all the
directions you do not take immediately, and look at them later, when
it finishes its current walk.

In a normal-sized picture there are a _lot_ of pixels. Thus, you must
take care to do the minimal amount of work required, or your program
will take a very long to run. For example, every walk must ignore
pixels seen by previous walks, so that it does not redo work that has
already been done.

I recommend calling `fillRect` for individual pixels when a pixel that
should be colored is found, and keeping some data structure that tells
you about all the pixels that have already been looked at.

!!solution!!

Given a pair of starting coordinates and the image data for the whole
canvas, this approach should work:

 1. Create an array to hold information about already colored
    coordinates.

 2. Create a work list array to hold coordinates that must be looked
    at. Put the start position in it.

 3. When the work list is empty, we are done.

 4. Remove one pair of coordinates from the work list.

 5. If those coordinates are already in our array of colored pixels, go
    back to 3.

 6. Color the pixel at the current coordinates, and add them to the
    array of colored pixels.

 7. Add the coordinates of each adjacent pixel whose color is the same
    as the starting pixel's original color to the work list.

 8. Return to 3.

The work list can simply be an array of vector objects. The data
structure that tracks colored pixels will be consulted _very_ often.
Searching through the whole thing every time a new pixel is visited
will take a lot of time. You could instead create an array that has a
value in it for every pixel, using again the x + y × width scheme for
associating positions with pixels, and when checking if a pixel has
been colored already, directly access the field corresponding to the
current pixel.

Comparing colors can be done by running over the relevant part of the
data array, comparing one field at a time. Or you can “condense” a
color down to a single number or string, and compare those. When doing
this, ensure that every color produces a unique value. For example,
simply adding the color's components is not safe, since multiple
colors will have the same sum.

When enumerating the neighbors of a given point, take care to exclude
neighbors that are not inside of the canvas, or your program might run
off into one direction forever.
