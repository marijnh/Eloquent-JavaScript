Building your own programming language is surprisingly easy (as long as
you do not aim too high) and very enlightening.

The main thing I want to show in this chapter is that there is no
magic involved in building your own language. I've often felt that some human inventions were so
immensely clever and complicated that I'd never be able to understand
them. But with a little reading and tinkering, such things often turn out to be quite mundane.

We will build a programming language called Egg. It will be a tiny, simple language, but one
that is powerful enough to express any computation you can think of. It will also allow
simple abstraction based on functions.

[[parsing]]
== Parsing ==

The most immediately visible part of a programming language is its
_syntax_, or notation. A parser is a program that reads a piece of text
and produces a data structure that reflects the structure of the
program contained in that text. If the text does not form a valid
program, the parser should complain and point out the
error.

Our language will have a very simple and uniform syntax. Everything in
Egg is an expression. An expression can be a variable, a
number, a string, or an _application_. Applications are used for
function calls, but also for constructs like `if` or `while`.

To keep the parser simple, strings in Egg do not support
anything like backslash escapes. A string is simply a sequence of
characters that are not double quotes, wrapped in double quotes.
A number is a sequence of digits. Variable names can consist of
any character that is not whitespace and does not have a special
meaning in the syntax.

Applications are written the way they are in JavaScript, by putting
parentheses after an expression, and having any number of arguments
separated by commas between those parentheses.

----
do(define(x, 10),
   if(>(x, 5)),
      print("large"),
      print("small"))
----

The uniformity of the Egg language means that things which are operators
in JavaScript (such as `>`) are normal variables in this language,
applied just like other functions. And since the syntax has no concept
of a block, we need a `do` construct (like above) to represent
doing multiple things in sequence.

The data structure the parser will use to describe a program will
consist of expression objects, each of which has a `type` property indicating
the kind of expression it is and other properties to describe its content.

Expresions of type `"value"` represent literal strings or numbers. Their `value`
property contains the string or number value that they represent. Expressions of type
`"word"` are used for identifiers (names). Their `name` property holds their content
as a string. Finally, `"apply"` expressions represent applications. They have an `operator` property
// "content as a string" -> "string content"
that refers to the expression that is being applied, and an `args` property that refers
to an array of argument expressions.

The `>(x, 5)` part of the program above would be represented like this:

[source,application/json]
----
{
  type: "apply",
  operator: {type: "word", name: ">"},
  args: [
    {type: "word", name: "x"},
    {type: "value", value: 5}
  ]
}
----

Such a data structure is called a _syntax tree_. If you imagine the
objects as dots, and the links between them as lines between those
dots, it has a tree-like shape. The fact that expressions contain
other expressions, which in turn might contain more expression, is
similar to the way branches split and split again.

image::img/syntax_tree.svg[alt="The structure of a syntax tree",width="5cm"]

Contrast this to the parser we wrote for the configuration file format
in link:09_regexp.html#ini[Chapter 9], which had a very simple
structure: it split the input into lines, and handled those lines one
at a time. There were only a few simple forms that a line was allowed
to have.

Here we must find a different approach. Expressions are not
separated into lines, and they have a recursive structure. Application
expressions _contain_ other expressions.

Fortunately, this problem can be solved elegantly by writing a parser
function that is recursive in a way that reflects the recursive nature
of the language.

We define a function `parseExpression`, which takes a string as input,
and returns an object containing the data structure for the
expression at the start of the string, along with the part of the
string left after parsing this expression. When parsing
sub-expressions (the argument to an application, for example), this
function can be called again, yielding the argument expression as well
as the text that remains. This text may in turn contain more arguments, or may
be the closing parenthesis that ends the list of arguments.

This is the first part of the parser:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function parseExpression(program) {
  program = skipSpace(program);
  var match, expr;
  if (match = /^"([^"]*)"/.exec(program))
    expr = {type: "value", value: match[1]};
  else if (match = /^\d+\b/.exec(program))
    expr = {type: "value", value: Number(match[0])};
  else if (match = /^[^\s(),"]+/.exec(program))
    expr = {type: "word", name: match[0]};
  else
    throw new SyntaxError("Unexpected syntax: " + program);

  return parseApply(expr, program.slice(match[0].length));
}

function skipSpace(string) {
  var first = string.search(/\S/);
  if (first == -1) return "";
  return string.slice(first);
}
----

Because Egg allows any amount of whitespace between its
elements, we have to repeatedly cut the whitespace off the start of
the program string. This is what the `skipSpace` function helps with.

After skipping any leading space, `parseExpression` uses three regular
expressions to spot the three simple (atomic) elements that Egg
supports: strings, numbers, and words. The parser constructs a
different kind of data structure depending on which one matches. If
none match, the input is not a valid expression, and it throws an
error. `SyntaxError` is a standard error object type, which is raised
when an attempt is made to run an invalid JavaScript program.

We can then cut off the part that we matched from the program string
and pass that, along with the object for the expression, to
`parseApply`, which checks whether the expression is an application. If so,
it parses a parenthesized list of arguments.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function parseApply(expr, program) {
  program = skipSpace(program);
  if (program[0] != "(")
    return {expr: expr, rest: program};

  program = skipSpace(program.slice(1));
  expr = {type: "apply", operator: expr, args: []};
  while (program[0] != ")") {
    var arg = parseExpression(program);
    expr.args.push(arg.expr);
    program = skipSpace(arg.rest);
    if (program[0] == ",")
      program = skipSpace(program.slice(1));
    else if (program[0] != ")")
      throw new SyntaxError("Expected ',' or ')'");
  }
  return parseApply(expr, program.slice(1));
}
----

If the next character in the program is not an opening parenthesis,
this is not an application, and `parseApply` simply returns the
expression it was given.

Otherwise, it skips the opening parenthesis, and creates the syntax
tree object for this application expression. It then recusively calls
`parseExpression` to parse each argument until a closing parenthesis
is found. The recursion is indirect, through `parseApply` and
`parseExpression` calling each other.

Because an application expression can itself be applied (such as in
`multiplier(2)(1)`), `parseApply` must, after it has parsed an application,
call itself again to check whether another pair of parentheses follow.

This is all we need to parse Egg. We wrap it in a convenient
`parse` function which verifies that it has reached the end of the input string
after parsing the program, and which gives us the program's data structure.

// include_code strip_log
// test: join

[source,javascript]
----
function parse(program) {
  var result = parseExpression(program);
  if (skipSpace(result.rest).length > 0)
    throw new SyntaxError("Unexpected text after program");
  return result.expr;
}

console.log(parse("+(a, 10)"));
// → {type: "apply",
//    operator: {type: "word", name: "+"},
//    args: [{type: "word", name: "a"},
//           {type: "value", value: 10}]}
----

It works! It doesn't give us very helpful information when it fails,
and doesn't store the line and column on which each expression
starts, which might be helpful when reporting errors later on, but it's
good enough for our purposes.

== The evaluator ==

What can we do with the syntax tree for a program? Run it, of course!
And that is what the evaluator does. You give it a syntax tree and an
environment object that associates names with values, and it will
evaluate the expression that the tree represents and return the value
that this produces.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function evaluate(expr, env) {
  switch(expr.type) {
    case "value":
      return expr.value;

    case "word":
      if (expr.name in env)
        return env[expr.name];
      else
        throw new ReferenceError("Undefined variable: " +
                                 expr.name);
    case "apply":
      if (expr.operator.type == "word" &&
          expr.operator.name in specialForms)
        return specialForms[expr.operator.name](expr.args,
                                                env);
      var op = evaluate(expr.operator, env);
      if (typeof op != "function")
        throw new TypeError("Applying a non-function.");
      return op.apply(null, expr.args.map(function(arg) {
        return evaluate(arg, env);
      }));
  }
}

var specialForms = Object.create(null);
----

The evaluator has code for each of the expression types. A literal
value expression simply produces its value.
(For example, the expression `100` just evaluates to the number 100.)
For a variable, we must check whether it is actually defined in the
environment, and if it is, fetch the variable's value.

Applications are more involved. If they are a special form, like `if`,
we do not evaluate anything, and simply pass the argument expressions,
along with the environment, to the function that handles this form. If
it is a normal call, we evaluate the operator, verify that it is a
function, and call it with the result of evaluating the arguments.

We will use plain JavaScript function values to represent Egg's
function values. We will come back to this
link:11_language.html#egg_fun[later], when the special form called `fun`
is defined.

The recursive structure of `evaluate` resembles the similar
structure of the parser. Both mirror the structure of the
language itself. It would also be possible integrate the parser
with the evaluator, and evaluate during parsing, but splitting them up
this way makes the program more readable.

This is really all that is needed to interpret Egg. It is that
simple. But without defining a few special forms and adding
some useful values to the environment, you can't do anything with this
language yet.

== Special forms ==

The `specialForms` object is used to define special syntax in Egg.
It associates words with functions that evaluate such
special forms. It is currently empty. Let's add some forms.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
specialForms["if"] = function(args, env) {
  if (args.length != 3)
    throw new SyntaxError("Bad number of args to if");

  if (evaluate(args[0], env) !== false)
    return evaluate(args[1], env);
  else
    return evaluate(args[2], env);
};
----

Egg's `if` construct expects exactly three arguments. It will
evaluate the first, and if the result isn't the value `false`, it
will evaluate the second. Otherwise, the third gets evaluated. Because
this `if` form is an expression, not a statement as it is in
JavaScript, it has a value—namely, the result of the second or third
argument.

Egg differs from JavaScript in how it handles the condition
value to `if`. It will not treat things like zero or the empty string as false,
but only the precise value `false`.

The reason we need to represent `if` as a special form, rather than a
regular function, is that all arguments to functional are evaluated
before the function is called, whereas `if` should only evaluate _either_
its second or its third argument, depending on the value of the first.

The `while` form is similar:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
specialForms["while"] = function(args, env) {
  if (args.length != 2)
    throw new SyntaxError("Bad number of args to while");

  while (evaluate(args[0], env) !== false)
    evaluate(args[1], env);

  // Since undefined does not exist in Egg, we return false,
  // for lack of a meaningful result.
  return false;
};
----

Another basic building block is `do`, which executes all its arguments
from top to bottom. Its value is the value produced by the last
argument.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
specialForms["do"] = function(args, env) {
  var value = false;
  args.forEach(function(arg) {
    value = evaluate(arg, env);
  });
  return value;
};
----

To be able to create variables and give them new values, we also
create a form called `define`. It expects a word as its first argument,
and an expression producing the value to assign to that word as its second
argument. Since `define`, like everything, is an expression, it must
return a value. We'll make it
return the value that was assigned (just like JavaScript's “`=`”
operator).

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
specialForms["define"] = function(args, env) {
  if (args.length != 2 || args[0].type != "word")
    throw new SyntaxError("Bad use of define");
  var value = evaluate(args[1], env);
  env[args[0].name] = value;
  return value;
};
----

== The environment ==

The environment accepted by `evaluate` is an object with properties
whose names correspond to variable names, and whose values correspond
to the values those variables are bound to. Let's define an environment object to
represent the global scope.

To be able to use the `if` construct we just defined, let's add support for
Boolean values in this global scope. Since there are only two boolean values,
we do not need special syntax for them. We simply bind two variables to the
values `true` and `false`, and use those.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
var topEnv = Object.create(null);

topEnv["true"] = true;
topEnv["false"] = false;
----

We can now evaluate a simple expression that inverts a Boolean value.

[source,javascript]
----
var prog = parse("if(true, false, true)");
console.log(evaluate(prog, topEnv));
// → false
----

To supply basic arithmetic and comparison
operators, we will also add some functions to the environment. In the
interest of keeping the code short, we'll use `new Function` to
synthesize a bunch of operator functions in a loop, rather than
defining them all individually.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
["+", "-", "*", "/", "==", "<", ">"].forEach(function(op) {
  topEnv[op] =
    new Function("a, b", "return a " + op + " b;");
});
----

A way to output values is also very useful, so we'll wrap `console.log`
in a function and call it `print`.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
topEnv["print"] = function(value) {
  console.log(value);
  return value;
};
----

That gives us enough elementary tools to write simple programs.
The following `run` function provides a convenient way to write and run them. It
creates a fresh environment, and parses and evaluates the
strings we give it as a single program.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function run() {
  var env = Object.create(topEnv);
  var program = Array.prototype.slice
    .call(arguments, 0).join("\n");
  return evaluate(parse(program), env);
}
----

The use of `Array.prototype.slice.call` above is a trick to turn an array-like object,
such as `arguments`, into a real array, so that we can call `join` on
it. It takes all the arguments given to `run` and treats them as the
lines of a program.

[source,javascript]
----
run("do(define(total, 0),",
    "   define(count, 1),",
    "   while(<(count, 11),",
    "         do(define(total, +(total, count)),",
    "            define(count, +(count, 1)))),",
    "   print(total))");
// → 55
----

This is the program we've seen several times before, which computes
the sum of the numbers 1 to 10,
expressed in Egg. It is clearly uglier than the
equivalent JavaScript program, but not bad for a language implemented
in less than 150 lines of code.

[[egg_fun]]
== Functions ==

A programming language without functions is a poor programming
language indeed.

Fortunately, it is not hard to add a `fun` construct, which treats its
last argument as the function's body, and all arguments before that as
the names of the function's arguments.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
specialForms["fun"] = function(args, env) {
  if (!args.length)
    throw new SyntaxError("Functions need a body");
  function name(expr) {
    if (expr.type != "word")
      throw new SyntaxError("Arg names must be words");
    return expr.name;
  }
  var argNames = args.slice(0, args.length - 1).map(name);
  var body = args[args.length - 1];

  return function() {
    if (arguments.length != argNames.length)
      throw new TypeError("Wrong number of arguments");
    var localEnv = Object.create(env);
    for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++)
      localEnv[argNames[i]] = arguments[i];
    return evaluate(body, localEnv);
  };
};
----

Functions in Egg have their own local environment, just like
in JavaScript. We use `Object.create` to make a new object that has
access to the variables in the outer environment (its prototype), but
can also contain new variables without modifying that outer scope.

The function created by the `fun` form creates this local environment,
and adds the argument variables to it. It then evaluates the function
body in this environment, and returns the result.

[source,javascript]
----
run("do(define(plusOne, fun(a, +(a, 1))),",
    "   print(plusOne(10)))");
// → 11

run("do(define(pow, fun(base, exp,",
    "     if(==(exp, 0),",
    "        1,",
    "        *(base, pow(base, -(exp, 1)))))),",
    "   print(pow(2, 10)))");
// → 1024
----

== Compilation ==

What we have built is an interpreter. During evaluation, it acts
directly on the representation of the program produced by the parser.

_Compilation_ is the process of adding another step between the parsing
and the running of a program, which transforms the program into
something that can be evaluated more efficiently by doing as much work
as possible in advance. For example, in well-designed languages it is
obvious, for each use of a variable, which variable is being referred to,
without actually running the program. This can be used to avoid
looking up the variable by name every time it is accessed, and
directly fetch it from some predetermined memory location.

Traditionally, compilation involves converting the program to machine
code, the raw format that a computer's processor can execute. But any
process that converts a program to a different representation can be
thought of as compilation.

It would be possible to write an alternative evaluation strategy for
Egg, one that first converts the program to a JavaScript program, uses
`new Function` to invoke the JavaScript compiler on it, and then runs
the result. When done right, this would make Egg run very fast, while
still being quite simple to implement.

If you are interested in this topic and willing to spend some time on
it, I encourage you to try to implement such a compiler as an
exercise.

== Cheating ==
// Heh, maybe "Good Artists Borrow, Great Artists Steal" ?

When we defined `if` and `while`, you probably noticed that they were
more or less trivial wrappers around JavaScript's own `if` and
`while`. Similarly, the values in Egg are just regular old
JavaScript values.

If you compare the implementation of Egg, built on top of
JavaScript, with the amount of work and complexity required to build a
programming language directly on the raw functionality provided by a
machine, the difference is huge. Regardless, this example hopefully
gave you an impression of the way programming languages work.

And when it comes to getting something done, cheating is more
effective than doing everything yourself. Though the toy language in
this chapter doesn't do anything that couldn't be done better in
JavaScript, there _are_ situations where writing small languages helps
get real work done.

Such a language does not have to resemble a typical programming
language. If JavaScript didn't come equipped with regular
expressions, you could write your own parser and evaluator for such a
sublanguage.

Or imagine you are building a giant robotic dinosaur, and need to
program its behavior. JavaScript might not be the most effective way
to do this. You might instead opt for a language that looks like this:

----
behavior walk
  perform when
    destination ahead
  actions
    move left-foot
    move right-foot

behavior attack
  perform when
    Godzilla in-view
  actions
    fire laser-eyes
    launch arm-rockets
----

This is what is usually called a _domain-specific language_, a
language tailored to express a narrow domain of knowledge. Such a language can
be more expressive than a general-purpose language because
it is designed to express exactly the things that need expressing in
its domain, and nothing else.

== Exercises ==

=== Arrays ===

Add support for arrays to Egg by adding the following three
functions to the top scope: `array(...)` which constructs an array
containing the argument values, `length(array)` to get an array's
length, and `element(array, n)` to fetch the n^th^ element
from an array.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
// Modify these definitions...

topEnv["array"] = "...";

topEnv["length"] = "...";

topEnv["element"] = "...";

run("do(define(sum, fun(array,",
    "     do(define(i, 0),",
    "        define(sum, 0),",
    "        while(<(i, length(array)),",
    "          do(define(sum, +(sum, element(array, i))),",
    "             define(i, +(i, 1)))),",
    "        sum))),",
    "   print(sum(array(1, 2, 3))))");
// → 6
----
endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

The easiest way to do this is to represent Egg arrays
with JavaScript arrays.

The values added to the top environment must be functions.
`Array.prototype.slice` can be used to convert an `arguments`
array-like object into a regular array.

!!solution!!

=== Closure ===

The way we have defined `fun` allows functions in Egg to
“close over” the surrounding environment, allowing the function's body
to use local values that were visible at the time the function was
defined, just like JavaScript functions do.

The program below illustrates this: function `f` returns a function
that adds its argument to `f`'s argument, meaning that it needs access
to the local scope inside `f` to be able to use variable `a`.

[source,javascript]
----
run("do(define(f, fun(a, fun(b, +(a, b)))),",
    "   print(f(4)(5)))");
// → 9
----

Go back to the definition of the `fun` form and explain which
mechanism causes this to work.

!!solution!!

Again, we are riding along on a JavaScript mechanism to get the
equivalent feature in Egg. Special forms are passed the
local environment in which they are evaluated, so that they can
evaluate their sub-forms in that environment. The function returned by
`fun` closes over the `env` argument given to its enclosing function,
and uses that to create the function's local environment when it is
called.

This means that the prototype of the local environment will be the
environment in which the function was created, which makes it possible
to access variables in that environment from the function. This is all
there is to implementing closure (though to compile it in a way that
is actually efficient, you'd need to do some more work).

!!solution!!

=== Comments ===

It would be nice if we could write comments in Egg. For
example, whenever we find a hash sign (“#”), we could treat the rest of the
line as a comment and ignore it, similar to “`//`” in JavaScript.

We do not have to make any big changes to the parser to support this.
We can simply change `skipSpace` to skip comments as if they are
whitespace, so that all the points where `skipSpace` is called will
now also skip comments. Make this change.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
// This is the old skipSpace. Modify it...
function skipSpace(string) {
  var first = string.search(/\S/);
  if (first == -1) return "";
  return string.slice(first);
}

console.log(parse("# hello\nx"));
// → {type: "word", name: "x"}

console.log(parse("a # one\n   # two\n()"));
// → {type: "apply",
//    operator: {type: "word", name: "x"},
//    args: []}
----
endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

Make sure your solution handles multiple comments in a row, with
potentially whitespace between or after them.

A regular expression is probably the easiest way to solve this. Write
something that matches “whitespace or a comment, zero or more
times”. Use the `exec` or `match` method, and look at the length
of the first element in the returned array (the whole match) to find
out how many characters to slice off.

!!solution!!

=== Fixing scope ===

Currently, the only way to assign a variable a value is `define`. This
construct acts both as a way to define new variables and to give
existing ones a new value.

This ambiguity causes a problem. When you try to give a non-local
variable a new value, you will end up defining a local one with the
same name instead. (Some languages work like this by design, but
I've always found it a silly way to handle scope.)

Add a special form `set`, similar to `define`, which gives a variable
a new value, updating the variable in an outer scope if it doesn't
already exist in the inner scope. If the variable is not defined at
all, throw a `ReferenceError`.

The technique of representing scopes as simple objects, which has made
things very convenient so far, will get in your way a little at this
point. You might want to use the `Object.getPrototypeOf` function,
which returns the prototype of an object. Also remember that
scopes do not derive from `Object.prototype`, so if you want to call
`hasOwnProperty` on them, you have to use this clumsy expression:

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(scope, name);
----

This fetches the `hasOwnProperty` method from the `Object` prototype,
and then calls it on a scope object.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
specialForms["set"] = function(args, env) {
  // Your code here.
};

run("do(define(x, 4),",
    "   define(setx, fun(val, set(x, val))),",
    "   setx(50),",
    "   print(x))");
// → 50
run("set(quux, true)");
// → Some kind of ReferenceError
----
endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

You will have to loop through one scope at a time, using
`Object.getPrototypeOf` to go the next outer scope. For each scope,
use `hasOwnProperty` to find out if the variable, indicated by the
`name` property of the first argument to `set`, exists in that scope.
If it does, set it to the result of evaluating the second argument to
`set`, and return that value.

If the outermost scope is reached (`Object.getPrototypeOf` returns
null) and we haven't found the variable yet, it doesn't exist, and an
error should be thrown.
