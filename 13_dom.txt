= The Document Object Model =

[quote,Le Hors et al,Document Object Model Core]
____
While it would be nice to have attribute and method names that are
short [...] DOM names tend to be long and descriptive in order to be
unique across all environments.
____

When you open a web page in your browser, it will retrieve the page's
HTML text, parse it in a way similar to the parser we wrote in Chapter
11, building up a model of its structure, and then it uses this model
to draw the page to the screen.

One of the toys that a JavaScript program has available in its sandbox
is this representation of the document. We can read from it, but also
change it. It acts as a _live_ data structure—when it is modified, the
page on the screen is updated to reflect the changes.

== Document structure ==

An HTML document can be visualized as a nested set of boxes. Tags like
`<body>` and `</body>` enclose other tags, which in turn contain other
tags (or text). Here's the example document one more time:

[sandbox="homepage"]
[source,text/html]
----
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My home page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My home page</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am Marijn and this is my home page.</p>
    <p>I also wrote a book! Read it
      <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net">here</a>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
----

This page has the following structure:

image::img/html-boxes.svg[alt="HTML document as nested boxes"]

The data structure the browser uses to represent the document follows
this shape. For each box, there is an object, which we can interact
with to find out things like what HTML tag it represents, and which
boxes and text it contains. This representation is called the
_Document Object Model_, DOM for short.

The global variable `document` gives us access to these objects. Its
`documentElement` property refers to the object representing the
`<html>` tag. It also provides properties `head` and `body`, holding
the objects for those elements.

== Trees ==

Think back to the syntax trees from Chapter 11 for a moment. Their
structure is strikingly similar to the structure of a browser's
document. Each _node_ may refer to other nodes, _children_, which may
have their own children. This shape is typical of nested structures
where elements can contain sub-elements that are similar to
themselves.

We call a data structure a _tree_ when it has a branching structure,
contains no cycles (a node may not contain itself, directly or
indirectly), and has a single, well-defined “root”.

Trees come up a lot in computer science. Apart from representing
recursive structures like HTML documents or programs from Chapter 11,
they are also often used to maintain sorted sets of data, because
elements can often be found or inserted more efficiently in a sorted
tree than in a sorted flat array.

A typical tree has different kinds of nodes. The syntax tree had
variables, values, and application nodes. Application nodes always had
children, variables and values were _leaves_, nodes without children.

The same goes for the DOM. Nodes for regular elements (the
representation of a tag in the document) determine the structure of
the document. These can have child nodes. An example of such a node is
`document.body`. Some of these children can be leaf nodes, such as
pieces of text or comments (which are written between `<!--` and `-->`
in HTML).

Each DOM node object has a `nodeType` property, which contains a
number code that identifies the type of node. Regular nodes have the
value 1 (which is also defined as the constant property
`document.ELEMENT_NODE`). Text nodes, representing a section of text
in the document, get type 3 (`document.TEXT_NODE`). Comments get type
8 (`document.COMMENT_NODE`).

So another way to visualize our document tree is:

image::img/html-tree.svg[alt="HTML document as a tree"]

The leaves are text nodes, and the arrows indicate
parent-child relationships between nodes.

== The standard ==

Using cryptic number codes to represent node types is not a very
JavaScript-like thing to do. Further on in this chapter, we'll see
that other parts of the DOM interface also feel cumbersome and alien.
The reason for this is that the DOM wasn't designed for just
JavaScript, but rather tries to define a language-neutral interface
that can be used in other systems as well, not just for HTML, but also
for XML, which is a generic data format with an HTML-like syntax.

This is unfortunate. Standards are often useful. But in this case, the
advantage (cross-language consistency) isn't all that compelling. And
the downside, having an interface that's not well integrated with the
language, is costly.

As an example of such poor integration, consider the `childNodes`
property that element nodes in the DOM have. This property holds an
array-like object, with a `length` property and properties labeled by
numbers (`0`, `1`) to access the child nodes. But it is an instance of
the `NodeList` type, not a real array, so it does not have methods
like `slice` and `forEach`.

Then there are issues that are simply the result of poor design. For
example, there is no way to create a new node and immediately add
children or attributes to it. Instead, you have to first create it,
then add the children one by one, and set the attributes one by one.
Code that interacts heavily with the DOM tends to get very long,
repetitive, and ugly.

But none of these are fatal, since JavaScript allows us to create our
own abstractions. It is easy to write some helper functions that allow
you to express the operations you are performing in a clearer and
shorter way. In fact, many libraries intended for browser programming
come with such tools.

== Moving through the tree ==

DOM nodes contain a wealth of links to other, nearby nodes. The
following diagram tries to illustrate these.

image::img/html-links.svg[alt="Links between DOM nodes"]

Every node has a `parentNode` property, pointing to the node it is
part of. The diagram only shows one of each link type. Every element
node (node type 1) has a `childNodes` property that points at a pseudo
array holding its children. Those represent the fundamental structure
of the tree.

In addition, there are a number of convenience links. The `firstChild`
and `lastChild` properties point to the first and last child element,
or have the value null for nodes without children. Similarly,
`previousSibling` and `nextSibling` point to adjacent nodes, nodes
with the same parent that appear immediately before or after the node
itself. For a first child, `previousSibling` will be null, and for a
last child, `nextSibling` is null.

When dealing with a data structure like this, whose structure repeats
itself as we go deeper, recursive functions are often useful. The one
below scans a document for text nodes containing a given string, and
returns true when it has found one.

[sandbox="homepage"]
[source,javascript]
----
function talksAbout(node, string) {
  if (node.nodeType == document.ELEMENT_NODE) {
    for (var i = 0; i < node.childNodes.length; i++) {
      if (talksAbout(node.childNodes[i], string))
        return true;
    }
    return false;
  } else if (node.nodeType == document.TEXT_NODE) {
    return node.nodeValue.indexOf(string) > -1;
  }
}

console.log(talksAbout(document.body, "book"));
// → true
----

The `nodeValue` property of a text node refers to the string of text
that it represents.

== Finding elements ==

Navigating these links to parents, children, and siblings is often
useful, as in the function above, which blindly runs through the whole
document. But if we want to find a specific node in the document,
reaching it by starting at `document.body` and following the various
kinds of links is a bad idea. It ties assumptions about the precise
structure of the document into our program, and we might want to
change that structure later. Another complicating factor is that text
nodes are created even for the whitespace (newlines and spaces)
between nodes. The example document's body tag does not have just
three children (`<h1>` and two `<p>`’s), but actually has 7 (those
three, plus the space before, after, and between them).

So if we want to get the `href` attribute of the link in that
document, we don't want to say something like “get the second child of
the sixth child of the document body”. It'd be better if we could say
“get the first link in the document”. And we can.

[sandbox="homepage"]
[source,javascript]
----
var link = document.body.getElementsByTagName("a")[0];
console.log(link.href);
----

All element nodes have a `getElementsByTagName` method, which collects
all elements with the given tag name that are descendants (direct or
indirect children) of the given node, and returns them as an
array-like object.

To find a specific _single_ node, you can give it an `id` attribute,
and use `document.getElementById` instead.

[source,text/html]
----
<p>My ostrich Gertrude:</p>
<p><img id="gertrude" src="img/ostrich.png"></p>

<script>
  var ostrich = document.getElementById("gertrude");
  console.log(ostrich.src);
</script>
----

A third, similar method is `getElementsByClassName`, which, like
`getElementsByTagName`, searches through the contents of an element
node, and retrieves all elements that have the given string in their
`class` attribute.

== Changing the document ==

Almost everything about the DOM data structure can be changed. Element
nodes have a number of methods that can be used to change their
content. The `removeChild` method removes the given child node from
the document. To add a child, we can use `appendChild`, which puts it
at the end of the list of children, or `insertBefore`, which inserts
the node given as first argument before the node given as second
argument.

[source,text/html]
----
<p>One</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Three</p>

<script>
  var paragraphs = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");
  document.body.insertBefore(paragraphs[2], paragraphs[0]);
</script>
----

A node can only exist in the document in one place. That is why
inserting paragraph “Three” in front of paragraph “One” will first
remove it from the end of the document, and then insert it at the
front, resulting in “Three/One/Two”. All operations that insert a node
somewhere will, as a side effect, cause it to be removed from its
current position (if it has one).

The `replaceChild` method is used to replace a child node with another
one. It takes as arguments two nodes, a new node, and the node that
must be replaced (which must be a child of the element the method is
called on). Note that both `replaceChild` and `insertBefore` expect
the _new_ node as their first argument.

== Creating nodes ==

In the next example, we want to write a script that replaces all
images (`<img>` tags) in the document with the text held in their
`alt` attribute (which is intended for specifying an alternative
textual representation of the image).

This involves not only removing the images, but adding a new text node
to replace them. For this, we use the `document.createTextNode`
method.

[source,text/html]
----
<p>The <img src="img/cat.png" alt="Cat"> in the
  <img src="img/hat.png" alt="Hat">.</p>

<p><button onclick="replaceImages()">Replace</button></p>

<script>
  function replaceImages() {
    var images = document.body.getElementsByTagName("img");
    for (var i = images.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      var image = images[i];
      if (image.alt) {
        var text = document.createTextNode(image.alt);
        image.parentNode.replaceChild(text, image);
      }
    }
  }
</script>
----

Given a string, `createTextNode` gives us a type 3 DOM node, which we
can insert into the document to make it show up on the screen.

The loop that goes over the images starts at the end of the
pseudo array. This is necessary because a node list returned by a
method like `getElementsByTagName` (or a property like `childNodes`)
is __live__—it is updated as the document changes. If we started from
the front, removing the first image would cause the list to lose its
first element, so that the second time the loop repeats, where `i` is
one, it would stop, because the length of the collection is now also
one.

If you want a _solid_ collection of nodes, that doesn't unexpectedly
change, you can convert them to a real array by calling the array
`slice` method on it.

[source,javascript]
----
var pseudo = {0: "one", 1: "two", length: 2};
var real = Array.prototype.slice.call(pseudo, 0);
real.forEach(function(elt) { console.log(elt); });
// → one
//   two
----

To create regular element nodes (type 1), we must use the
`document.createElement` method. This method takes a tag name, and
returns a new empty node of the given type.

The following example defines a utility `elt`, which creates an
element node, and treats the rest of its arguments as children to that
node. It then adds a simple footer to the document.

[source,text/html]
----
<h1>Page</h1>
<p>This is a document</p>

<script>
  function elt(type) {
    var node = document.createElement(type);
    for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) {
      var child = arguments[i];
      if (typeof child == "string")
        child = document.createTextNode(child);
      node.appendChild(child);
    }
    return node;
  }

  document.body.appendChild(
    elt("footer", "Written by ",
        elt("strong", "Sidonie Coene"),
        ", February 1914"));
</script>
----

== Attributes ==

Some element attributes, such as `href` for links, can be accessed
simply through a property of the same name, on the element's DOM
object. This is the case for a limited set of commonly used standard
attributes.

But HTML allows you to set any attribute you want on nodes. This can
be useful, as it allows you to store extra information for your
scripts in a document. If you make up your own attribute name, though,
it will not be present as a property on the element's node. Instead,
you'll have to use the `getAttribute` and `setAttribute` methods to
work with them.

[source,text/html]
----
<p data-classified="secret">The code is 0000.</p>
<p data-classified="unclassified">I have two feet.</p>

<script>
  var paras = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");
  Array.prototype.forEach.call(paras, function(para) {
    if (para.getAttribute("data-classified") == "secret")
      para.parentNode.removeChild(para);
  });
</script>
----

It is recommended to prefix the names of such made-up attributes with
`data-`, to ensure that they do not conflict with any other
attributes.

As a simple example, we'll write a “syntax highlighter” that looks for
`<pre>` tags (“pre-formatted”, used for code and similar plain text)
with a `data-language` attribute, and crudely tries to highlight the
keywords for that language.

// include_code

[sandbox="highlight"]
[source,javascript]
----
function highlightCode(node, keywords) {
  var text = node.innerText;
  node.innerText = ""; // Clear the node

  var match, pos = 0;
  while (match = keywords.exec(text)) {
    var before = text.slice(pos, match.index);
    node.appendChild(document.createTextNode(before));
    var strong = document.createElement("strong");
    strong.appendChild(document.createTextNode(match[0]));
    node.appendChild(strong);
    pos = keywords.lastIndex;
  }
  var after = text.slice(pos);
  node.appendChild(document.createTextNode(after));
}
----

The function `highlightCode` takes a `<pre>` node and a regular
expression (with the “global” option turned on) that matches the
keywords of the programming language that the element contains.

The `innerText` property is used to get all the text in the node, and
is then set to an empty string, which has the effect of emptying the
node. We loop over all matches of the keyword expression, appending
the text _between_ them as regular text nodes, and the text matched as
text nodes wrapping in `<strong>` (bold) elements.

We can automatically highlight all programs on the page by looping
over the `<pre>` elements that have a `data-language` attribute, and
calling `highlightCode` on them with the correct regular expression
for the language.

// include_code

[sandbox="highlight"]
[source,javascript]
----
var languages = {
  javascript: /\b(function|return|var)\b/g /* … etc */
};

function highlightAllCode() {
  var pres = document.body.getElementsByTagName("pre");
  for (var i = 0; i < pres.length; i++) {
    var pre = pres[i];
    var lang = pre.getAttribute("data-language");
    if (languages.hasOwnProperty(lang))
      highlightCode(pre, languages[lang]);
  }
}
----

For example:

[sandbox="highlight"]
[source,text/html]
----
<p>Here it is, the identity function:</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
function id(x) { return x; }
</pre>

<script>highlightAllCode();</script>
----

There is one commonly used attribute, `class`, which is a reserved
word in the JavaScript language. For historical reasons (some old
JavaScript implementation could not handle property names that matched
keywords or reserved words), the property used to access this
attribute is `className`. You can, of course, also access it with the
`getAttribute` and `setAttribute` methods.

== Layout ==

You will have noticed that different types of elements behave
differently. Some, such as paragraphs (`<p>`) or headings (`<h1>`), are
placed below each other, taking up the whole width of the document.
These are called _block_ elements. Others, such as links (`<a>`) or
the `<strong>` element used in the example above, are treated as part
of the surrounding text. Such elements are called _inline_ elements.

Browsers contain a component that, given a document, computes a
layout, which gives each element a size and position based on its type
and content. This layout is then used to actually draw the document.

The size and position of an element can be accessed from JavaScript.
The `offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight` properties give us the space the
element takes up, in pixels (the basic unit of measurement in the
browser, typically corresponding to the smallest dot that your screen
can display). Similarly, `clientWidth` and `clientHeight` give us the
size of the _inside_ of the element, ignoring border width.

[source,text/html]
----
<p style="border: 3px solid red">
  Do not cross the border.
</p>

<script>
  var para = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p")[0];
  console.log("clientHeight:", para.clientHeight);
  console.log("offsetHeight:", para.offsetHeight);
</script>
----

The most effective way to find the precise position of an element on
the screen is the `getBoundingClientRect` method. It returns an object
with `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties indicating the
pixel positions of the sides of the element, relative to the top left
of the _screen_. If you want them relative to the whole document, you
must add the current scroll position, found under the global
`pageXOffset` and `pageYOffset` variables.

Laying out a document can be quite a lot of work. In the interest of
speed, browser engines do not immediately re-layout a document every
time it is changed, but rather wait as long as they can. When a
JavaScript program finishes running, they will have to show the
changes to the document on the screen, which involves computing the
layout. When a program _asks_ for the position or size of something
(by reading properties like `offsetHeight` or calling
`getBoundingClientRect`), providing correct information also requires
computing a layout.

A program that repeatedly alternates between reading DOM layout
information and changing the DOM will force a lot of layouts to
happen, and consequently run really slowly. This page demonstrates the
difference. It contains two different programs that build up a line of
“X” characters 2000 pixels wide, and measures the time they take.

// test: nonumbers

[source,text/html]
----
<p><span id="one"></span></p>
<p><span id="two"></span></p>

<script>
  function time(name, action) {
    var start = Date.now(); // Current time in milliseconds
    action();
    console.log(name, "took", Date.now() - start, "ms");
  }

  time("naive", function() {
    var target = document.getElementById("one");
    while (target.offsetWidth < 2000)
      target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("X"));
  });
  // → naive took 32 ms

  time("clever", function() {
    var target = document.getElementById("two");
    target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("XXXXX"));
    var total = Math.ceil(2000 / (target.offsetWidth / 5));
    for (var i = 5; i < total; i++)
      target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("X"));
  });
  // → clever took 1 ms
</script>
----

== Styling ==

We have seen a number of different elements displaying different
behavior. Some are displayed as blocks, others inline. Some add
styling, like `<strong>` making its content bold, and `<a>` making it
blue and underlining it.

Some of this behavior is strongly tied to the element type. For
example the way an `<img>` tag shows an image or an `<a>` tag causes
a link to be followed when it is clicked. Other behavior, such as
boldness or color, are simply default styles that the browser assigns
to the element, and can be changed by us. For example by using the
`style` property.

[source,text/html]
----
<p><a href=".">Normal link</a></p>
<p><a href="." style="color: green">Green link</a></p>
----

A style attribute may contain one or more _declarations_, which are a
property (such as `color`) followed by a colon and a value (such as
`green`). When there are more than one declaration, they must be
separated by semicolons. For example “`color: red; border: none`”.

There are a lot apects that can be influenced with styling. For
example, whether an element is displayed as a block or inline is
controlled by the `display` property.

[source,text/html]
----
This is text with an <strong>inline</strong>,
<strong style="display: block">block</strong>, and
<strong style="display: none">hidden</strong> tag.
----

The “block” tag will end up on its own line, since block elements are
not displayed inline with the text around them. The “hidden” tag is
not displayed at all—`display: none` prevents an element from showing
up on the screen. This allows us to hide elements, in a way that is
often preferable to removing them from the document entirely, since it
makes it much easier to reveal them again later.

The style of an element can be manipulated directly by a JavaScript
program through the node's `style` property. This property holds an
object that has properties for all possible style properties. The
values of these properties are strings, which we can write to in order
to change a particular aspect of the element's style.

[source,text/html]
----
<p id="para" style="color: purple">
  Pretty text
</p>

<script>
  var para = document.getElementById("para");
  console.log(para.style.color);
  para.style.color = "magenta";
</script>
----

Some style property names contain dashes, for example `font-family`.
Because such property names are awkward to work with in JavaScript
(you'd have to say `style["font-family"]`), the corresponding property
names in the `style` object remove the dashes and capitalize the
letter that follows them (`style.fontFamily`).

== Cascading styles ==

The styling system for HTML is called CSS, for _Cascading Style
Sheets_. A style _sheet_ is a set of rules for how to style elements
in the document. It can be given inside a `<style>` tag.

[source,text/html]
----
<style>
  strong {
    font-style: italic;
    color: grey;
  }
</style>
<p>Now <strong>strong text</strong> is italic and grey.</p>
----

The _cascading_ in the name refers to the fact that multiple such
rules are combined to produce the actual style for an element. In the
example above, the default styling for `<strong>` tags, which gives
them `font-weight: bold`, is overlaid by the rule in the `<style>`
tag, which adds `font-style` and `color`.

When multiple rules define a value for the same property (for example
if the rule in the `<style>` tag included `font-weight: normal`,
disagreeing with the default `font-weight` rule), the most recently
read rule gets a higher precedence and wins out (so in this case, the
text would not be bold). Styles in a `style` attribute applied
directly to the node have the highest precedence, and always win.

It is possible to target things other than tag names in CSS rules. A
rule for `.abc` applies to all elements with `abc` in their class
attribute. A rule for `#xyz` applies to the element with an `id`
attribute of `xyz`.

[source,text/css]
----
.subtle {
  color: grey;
  font-size: 80%;
}
#header {
  background: blue;
  color: white;
}
/* p elements, with classes a and b, and id main */
p.a.b#main {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
----

The precedence rule favoring the most recently defined rule only holds
when the rules have the same _specificity_. Specificity depends on the
amount of aspects of the tag that the rule matches. Simply said, `p.a`
is more specific than just `p` or just `.a`, and thus would take
precedence to them.

The notation `p > a {…}` applies the given styles to all `<a>` tags
that are direct children of `<p>` tags. Similarly, `p a {…}` applies
to all `<a>` tags inside `<p>` tags, whether they are direct or
indirect children.

== Query selectors ==

We won't be using style sheets all that much in this book.
Understanding them is crucial to programming in the browser, but
properly explaining all properties they support, and the interaction
between those, would take three or four books itself.

The main reason I introduced _selector_ syntax—the notation used in
style sheets to determine which elements a set of styles apply to—is
that we can use this same mini-language as a more effective way to
find DOM elements.

The `querySelectorAll` method (defined both on the `document` object
and on element nodes) takes a selector string, and returns a pseudo
array containing all the elements that it matches.

[source,text/html]
----
<p>And if you go chasing
  <span class="animal">rabbits</span></p>
<p>And you know you're going to fall</p>
<p>Tell 'em a <span class="character">hookah smoking
  <span class="animal">caterpillar</span></span></p>
<p>Has given you the call</p>

<script>
  function count(selector) {
    return document.querySelectorAll(selector).length;
  }
  console.log(count("p"));           // All <p> elements
  // → 4
  console.log(count(".animal"));     // Class animal
  // → 2
  console.log(count("p .animal"));   // Animal inside of <p>
  // → 2
  console.log(count("p > .animal")); // Direct child of <p>
  // → 1
</script>
----

The `querySelector` (without the `All` part) method works in a similar
way. This one is useful if you want a specific, single element. It
will return only the first matching element, or null if no elements
match.

== Positioning and animating ==

The `position` style property influences layout in an interesting way.
By default it has a value of `static`, meaning the element sits in its
normal place in the document.

When it is set to `relative`, the element still takes up space in the
document, but the `top` and `left` style properties can be used to
move it relative to its normal place. When `position` is set to
`absolute` the element is removed from the normal document flow (it no
longer takes up space), and its `top` and `left` properties can be
used to absolutely position it (relative to the top left of the
document, or the nearest enclosing element whose `position` property
isn't `static`).

We can use this to create an animation. The document below displays a
spinning picture of a cat.

[source,text/html]
----
<p style="text-align: center">
  <img src="img/cat.png" style="position: relative">
</p>
<script>
  var cat = document.querySelector("img");
  var angle = 0, lastTime = null;
  function animate(time) {
    if (lastTime != null)
      angle += (time - lastTime) * 0.001;
    lastTime = time;
    cat.style.top = (Math.sin(angle) * 20) + "px";
    cat.style.left = (Math.cos(angle) * 200) + "px";
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
</script>
----

First, the picture is centered on the page, and given a `position` of
`relative`. The script defines a counter (`angle`) to control the
animation, and every time `animate` is called, it increments this
counter 0.001 unit for every millisecond elapsed. To determine how
much time is elapsed, the time for the previous call is stored, and
compared to the current time. The `angle` is measured in radians
rather than degrees, which means that a full circle is indicated by
2π, not 360.

It then computes a `top` and `left` style based on the sine and cosine
of the current angle, multiplying the first by 20 and the second by
200 to get an elliptical motion. If you are not familiar with
trigonometry, don't worry too much about this part, just believe me
when I say that those calls to `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` compute a
position on a circle.

Note that styles usually need _units_. In this case, we have to append
`"px"` to the number to tell the browser we are counting in pixels (as
opposed to centimeters, “ems”, or other units). This is easily
forgotten. Using numbers without unit will result in your style being
ignored (unless the number is 0, which means the same regardless of
its unit).

If we just did this in a loop, the page would freeze and nothing would
show up on the display. Browsers do not update their display (nor do
they allow any interaction with the page) while a JavaScript program
is running. This means we need to somehow arrange for our function to
be run repeatedly, while still giving the browser time to do other
things.

The `requestAnimationFrame` function schedules the function it is
given as argument to be called whenever the browser is ready to
repaint the screen. Our animation function is passed the current time
as argument, which it uses to make the animation smooth. If it would
just increment the angle a fixed amount each step, it would look
stuttery when, for example, some other heavy task running on the same
computer prevented the function from running for a fraction of a
second.

The `animate` function itself again calls `requestAnimationFrame` to
schedule the next update. When the browser window (or tab) is active,
this will cause updates to happen at a rate of about 60 per second,
which tends to produce a nicely smooth animation.

== Summary ==

JavaScript programs may inspect and interfere with the current
document that a browser is displaying through a data structure called
the DOM. This data structure represents the browser's model of the
document, and a JavaScript program may modify it to change the
document.

The DOM is shaped like a tree, in which elements are arranged
hierarchically according to the structure of the document. The objects
representing elements have properties like `parentNode` and
`childNodes`, which can be used to navigate through this tree.

The way a document is displayed can be influenced by _styling_, both
by attaching styles to nodes directly, and by defining rules that
match certain nodes. There are many different properties, such as
`color` or `display`, that can be set. JavaScript can manipulate an
element's style directly through its `style` property.

== Exercises ==

=== Build a table ===

We built plain-text tables in Chapter 6. HTML makes laying out tables
quite a bit easier. An HTML table is built with the following tag
structure:

[source,text/html]
----
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>height</th>
    <th>country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kilimanjaro</td>
    <td>5895</td>
    <td>Tanzania</td>
  </tr>
</table>
----

For each _row_, the `<table>` tag contains a `<tr>` tag. Inside of
these, we can put cell elements, either heading cells (`<th>`) or
regular cells (`<td>`).

The same source data that was used in Chapter 6 is again available in
the `MOUNTAINS` variable in the sandbox, and also
http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/mountains.js[downloadable] from the
list of data sets on the website!!tex (`eloquentjavascript.net/code`)!!.

Write a function `buildTable` that, given an array of objects (which
all have the same set of properties), builds up a DOM structure
representing a table, with the property names wrapped in `<th>`
elements on the top row, followed by one row per object, containing
the property values in `<td>` elements.

The `Object.keys` function, which returns an array containing the
property names that an object has, will probably be helpful again.

Once you have the basics working, right-align cells containing numbers
by setting their `style.textAlign` property to `"right"`.

<style>
  /* Defines a cleaner look for tables */
  table  { border-collapse: collapse; }
  td, th { border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px 8px; }
  th     { text-align: left; }
</style>

<script>
  function buildTable(data) {
    // Your code here.
  }

  document.body.appendChild(buildTable(MOUNTAINS));
</script>
----
endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

Use `document.createElement` to create new element nodes,
`document.createTextNode` to create text nodes, and the `appendChild`
method to put nodes into other nodes.

The key names should be looped over once to fill in the top row, and
then once again for each object in the array to construct the data
rows.

Don't forget to return the enclosing `<table>` element at the end of
the function.

!!solution!!

== Elements by tag name ==

The `getElementsByTagName` method returns all child elements with a
given tag name. Implement your own version of it, as a regular
non-method function, which takes a node and a string (the tag name) as
arguments, and returns a (real) array containing all descendant
element nodes with the given tag name.

Note that the `tagName` property, for normal documents, will return
the tag name in all upper case. Use the `toLowerCase` or `toUpperCase`
string method to compensate for this.

<h1>Heading with a <span>span</span> element.</h1>
<p>A paragraph with <span>one</span>, <span>two</span>
  spans.</p>

<script>
  function byTagName(node, tagName) {
    // Your code here.
  }

  console.log(byTagName(document.body, "h1").length);
  // → 1
  console.log(byTagName(document.body, "span").length);
  // → 3
  var para = document.querySelector("p");
  console.log(byTagName(para, "span").length);
  // → 2
</script>
----
endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

This is most easily expressed with a recursive function, similar to
the `talksAbout` function defined earlier in this chapter.

You could call `byTagname` itself recursively, concatenating the
resulting arrays to produce the output. For a more efficient approach,
define an inner function which calls itself recursively, and which
has access to an array defined in the outer function to which it can
add the matching elements it finds. Do not forget to call the inner
function once from the outer function.

The recursive function must check the node type. In this case, we are
only interested in node type 1 (`document.ELEMENT_NODE`). For such
nodes, we must loop over their children, and for each child, see if it
matches the query, but also do a recursive call on it to inspect its
own children.

!!solution!!

== The cat's hat ==

Extend the spinning cat animation we defined earlier to have both the
cat and his hat (`<img src="img/hat.png">`) spin around, at opposite
sides of the circle.

Or make the hat circle around the cat. Or alter the animation in some
other interesting way.

To make positioning multiple objects easier, it is probably a good
idea to switch to absolute positioning. This means that `top` and
`left` are counted relative to the top left of the document, so you
probably want to avoid using negative coordinates. This can simply be
done by adding a fixed number of pixels to the values.

// test: no

[source,text/html]

<img src="img/cat.png" id="cat" style="position: absolute">
<img src="img/hat.png" id="hat" style="position: absolute">

  var cat = document.querySelector("#cat");
  var hat = document.querySelector("#hat");
  // Your code here.
</script>
