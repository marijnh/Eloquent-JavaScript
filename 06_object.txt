= The Secret Life of Objects =

When a programmer says “object”, that term is loaded. Objects, in my
profession, are a way of life, the subject of several holy wars, and a
beloved buzzword that still hasn't quite lost its power.

To an outsider, that is probably a little confusing. Let us start with
a brief history of objects as a programming construct.

== History ==

(((object-oriented programming)))(((object)))This story, like many
stories in this field, starts with the problem of controlling
complexity. One philosophy is that this complexity can be made
manageable by separating it into small compartments that are isolated
from each other. These compartments ended up with the name “objects.”

(((encapsulation)))(((method)))(((interface)))An object is a hard
shell that encapsulates the gooey complexity inside of it, and instead
offers us a few knobs and connectors (think methods) that present
an _interface_ through which the object is to be used. The idea is
that the interface is relatively simple, and all the complex things
going on _inside_ of the object can be ignored when working with it.

As an example, you can imagine an object that provides an interface to
an area on your screen. It provides a way to draw shapes or text onto
this area, but hides all the details of how these shapes are converted
to the actual pixels that make up the screen. You'd have a set of
methods, for example `drawCircle`, and those are the only things you
need to know in order to use such an object.

These ideas were initially worked out in the 1970s and 80s, and, in
the 90s, were carried up by a huge wave of hype—the object-oriented
programming revolution. Suddenly, there was a large tribe of people
declaring that objects were the _right_ way to program, and that
anything that did not involve objects was outdated nonsense.

That kind of zealotry always produces a lot of impractical silliness,
and there has been a sort of counter-revolution since then which has,
in many circles, given objects a bad reputation.

I feel it is preferable to look at the issue from a practical, rather
than ideological angle. There are several very useful concepts, most
importantly that of _encapsulation_ (distinguishing between internal
complexity and external interface), that the object-oriented culture
has popularized. These are worth studying.

This chapter describes JavaScript's rather eccentric take on objects,
and the way they relate to some classical object-oriented techniques.

== Methods ==

(((rabbit example)))(((method)))(((property)))Methods are simply
properties that hold function values. This is a very simple method:

[source,javascript]
----
var rabbit = {};
rabbit.speak = function(line) {
  console.log("The rabbit says '" + line + "'");
};

rabbit.speak("I'm alive.");
// → The rabbit says 'I'm alive.'
----

(((this variable)))Usually a method needs to know about the object it
is acting on. For example, if there are different rabbits, the `speak`
method must indicate which rabbit is speaking.

When a function is called as a method—when it is looked up as a
property and immediately called, as in ++object.method()++—the special
variable `this` in its body will point to the object that it was
called on.

// test: join
// include_code top_lines:6

[source,javascript]
----
function speak(line) {
  console.log("The " + this.type + " rabbit says '" +
              line + "'");
}
var whiteRabbit = {type: "white", speak: speak};
var fatRabbit = {type: "fat", speak: speak};

whiteRabbit.speak(
  "Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!");
// → The white rabbit says 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how
//    late it's getting!'
fatRabbit.speak("I could sure use a carrot right now.");
// → The fat rabbit says 'I could sure use a carrot
//   right now.'
----

The code uses the `this` variable to output the type of rabbit that is
speaking.

(((apply method)))(((bind method)))So the first argument to the
`apply` and `bind` methods on functions is in fact used to give a
value to `this`.

There is a method similar to `apply`, called `call`, which also calls
the function, but takes its arguments normally, rather than as an
array. It is used to call a function with a specific `this`
value.

[source,javascript]
----
speak.apply(fatRabbit, ["Burp!"]);
// → The fat rabbit says 'Burp!'
speak.call({type: "old"}, "Oh my.");
// → The old rabbit says 'Oh my.'
----

== Prototypes ==

(((toString method)))Watch closely.

[source,javascript]
----
var empty = {};
console.log(empty.toString);
// → function toString(){…}
console.log(empty.toString());
// → [object Object]
----

I just pulled a property out of an empty object. Magic!

(((prototype)))(((property)))Well, not really. I have simply been
withholding some information on the way JavaScript objects work. In
addition to their set of properties, almost all objects also have a
_prototype_. A prototype is another object that is used as a fall-back
source of properties. When a property is requested that an object does
not have, its prototype will be searched for the property, and then
the prototype of the prototype, and so on.

(((Object.prototype)))So who is the prototype of that empty object? It
is the great ancestral prototype, the entity behind almost all
objects, he who is himself prototype-less. His name is
`Object.prototype`.

[source,javascript]
----
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf({}) ==
            Object.prototype);
// → true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype));
// → null
----

The prototype relations of JavaScript objects form a tree-shaped
structure, and at the root of this structure sits `Object.prototype`.
It provides a few methods that show up in all objects, such as
`toString`, which converts an object to some string representation.

Many objects don't directly have `Object.prototype` as their
prototype, but instead have another object, which provides additional
default properties. This prototype will itself have a prototype, so
that it still indirectly provides methods like `toString`.

Functions derive from `Function.prototype`, arrays from
`Array.prototype`.

[source,javascript]
----
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(isNaN) ==
            Function.prototype);
// → true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf([]) ==
            Array.prototype);
// → true
----

The `Object.getPrototypeOf` function obviously returns the prototype
of an object. You can use `Object.create` to create an object with a
specific prototype.

[source,javascript]
----
var protoRabbit = {
  speak: function(line) {
    console.log("The " + this.type + " rabbit says '" +
                line + "'");
  }
};
var killerRabbit = Object.create(protoRabbit);
killerRabbit.type = "killer";
killerRabbit.speak("SKREEEE!");
// → The killer rabbit says 'SKREEEE!'
----

The proto rabbit contains the properties that are shared by all
rabbits. The killer rabbit itself contains the properties that apply
only to that object, in this case its type, and derives the shared
properties from its prototype.

== Constructors ==

(((new operator)))(((this variable)))(((return
keyword)))(((constructor)))A more convenient way to create objects
that derive from some shared prototype is to use a _constructor_. In
JavaScript, calling a function with the `new` keyword in front of it
causes it to be treated as a constructor. It will have its `this`
variable bound to a fresh object, and, unless it explicitly returns
something else, this new object will be returned from the call.

Here is a simple constructor for rabbits. It is convention to
capitalize the names of constructors, so that they are easily
distinguished from other functions.

// include_code top_lines:6

[source,javascript]
----
function Rabbit(type) {
  this.type = type;
}

var killerRabbit = new Rabbit("killer");
var blackRabbit = new Rabbit("black");
console.log(blackRabbit.type);
// → black
----

A constructor automatically gets a property `prototype`, which
initially holds a plain object that derives from `Object.prototype`.
New objects created with this constructor will get this object as
their prototype. So to add a `speak` method to rabbits created with
the `Rabbit` constructor, we can simply do this:

// include_code top_lines:4

[source,javascript]
----
Rabbit.prototype.speak = function(line) {
  console.log("The " + this.type + " rabbit says '" +
              line + "'");
};
blackRabbit.speak("Doom...");
// → The black rabbit says 'Doom...'
----

An object created with `new` is said to be an _((instance))_ of its
constructor.

== Overriding derived properties ==

(((property)))When you add a property to an object, whether it is
present in the prototype or not, that property is added to the object
itself, and the property by the same name in the prototype, if any,
will no longer affect the object. The prototype itself is not changed.

[source,javascript]
----
Rabbit.prototype.teeth = "small";
console.log(killerRabbit.teeth);
// → small
killerRabbit.teeth = "long, sharp, and bloody";
console.log(killerRabbit.teeth);
// → long, sharp, and bloody
console.log(blackRabbit.teeth);
// → small
----

The following diagram sketches the situation after this code has run.
The `Rabbit` and `Object` prototypes lie behind `killerRabbit` as a
kind of backdrop, where properties that are not found in the object
itself can be looked up.

image::img/rabbits.svg[alt="Rabbit object prototype schema"]

Overriding properties that exist in a prototype is often a useful
thing to do. As the rabbit teeth example shows, it can be used to
express exceptional properties in instances of a more generic class of
objects, while letting the non-exceptional objects simply take a
standard value from their prototype.

It is also used to give the standard function and array prototypes a
different `toString` method than the basic object prototype.

[source,javascript]
----
console.log(Array.prototype.toString ==
            Object.prototype.toString);
// → false
console.log([1, 2].toString());
// → 1,2
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call([1, 2]));
// → [object Array]
----

Calling `toString` on an array gives a result similar to calling
`.join(",")` on it—it puts commas between the values in the array.
Directly calling `Object.prototype.toString` with an array produces a
different string. That function doesn't know about arrays, it simply
puts the word “object” and the name of the type between square
brackets.

== Prototype interference ==

A prototype can be used at any time to add new properties and methods
to all objects based on it. For example, it might become necessary for
our rabbits to dance.

[source,javascript]
----
Rabbit.prototype.dance = function() {
  console.log("The " + this.type + " rabbit dances a jig.");
};
killerRabbit.dance();
// → The killer rabbit dances a jig.
----

That's very convenient. But there are situations where it causes
problems. In the previous chapter, we used an object as a way to
associate values with names by creating properties for the names and
giving them the corresponding value as value. Here's a similar example
from chapter 4:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
var ages = {};
function storeAge(name, age) {
  ages[name] = age;
}

storeAge("Larry", 58);
storeAge("Simon", 55);
----

(((for/in loop)))(((in operator)))We can iterate over all persons in
the object using a `for`/`in` loop, and test whether a name is in
there using the regular `in` operator. But unfortunately, the object's
prototype gets in the way.

[source,javascript]
----
Object.prototype.nonsense = "hi";
for (var name in ages)
  console.log(name);
// → Larry
// → Simon
// → nonsense
console.log("nonsense" in ages);
// → true
console.log("toString" in ages);
// → true
delete Object.prototype.nonsense;
----

That's all wrong. There is no person called “nonsense” in our data
set. And there _definitely_ is no person called “toString”.

(((enumerability)))Oddly, `toString` did not show up in the `for`/`in`
loop, but the `in` operator did return true for it. JavaScript
distinguishes between _enumerable_ and _non-enumerable_ properties.

All properties that we create by simply assigning to them are
enumerable. The standard properties in `Object.prototype` are all
non-enumerable, which is why they do not show up in such a `for`/`in`
loop.

(((defineProperty function)))It is possible to define our own
non-enumerable properties by using the `Object.defineProperty`
function, which allows us more control of the type of property we are
creating.

[source,javascript]
----
Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, "hiddenNonsense",
                      {enumerable: false, value: "hi"});
for (var name in ages)
  console.log(name);
// → Larry
// → Simon
console.log(ages.hiddenNonsense);
// → hi
----

(((hasOwnProperty method)))So now the property is there, but it won't
show up in a loop. That is good. But we still have the problem with
the regular `in` operator claiming that the `Object.prototype`
properties exists in our object. For that, we can use the object's
`hasOwnProperty` operator.

[source,javascript]
----
console.log(ages.hasOwnProperty("toString"));
// → false
----

This method tells us whether the object has the property _itself_,
without looking at its prototypes. This is often a more useful piece
of information than what the `in` operator gives us.

When you are worried that someone (some other code you loaded into
your program) might have messed with the base object prototype, it is
recommended to write your `for`/`in` loops like this:

[source,javascript]
----
for (var name in ages) {
  if (ages.hasOwnProperty(name)) {
    // ... this is a real property
  }
}
----

== Prototype-less objects ==

But the rabbit hole doesn't end there. What if someone registered the
name `hasOwnProperty` in our `ages` object? Now the call to
`ages.hasOwnProperty` will try to call the local property, which will
hold a number, not a function.

Often, prototypes just get in the way, and we actually want nothing to
do with them. We saw the `Object.create` function, which allows us to
create an object with a specific prototype. You are allowed to pass
`null` as the prototype to create a fresh object with no prototype.
For objects like `ages`, where the properties could be anything, this
is exactly what we want.

[source,javascript]
----
var ages = Object.create(null);
ages.Brendan = 52;
console.log("toString" in ages);
// → false
console.log("Brendan" in ages);
// → true
----

Much better! Now we do not need the `hasOwnProperty` kludge—because
all the properties the object has are its own properties—and we can
safely use `for`/`in` loops, no matter what people have been doing to
`Object.prototype`.

== Polymorphism ==

(((toString method)))(((String function)))(((polymorphism)))When you
call the `String` function on an object, it will call the `toString`
method on that object to try and create a meaningful string to return.
I mentioned that some of the standard prototypes define their own
version of `toString`, in order to be able to create a string that
contains more useful information than `"[object Object]"`.

This is a simple instance of a very powerful idea. When a piece of
code is written to work with objects that have a certain interface—in
this case, a `toString` method—any kind of object that happens to
support this interface can be plugged into the code, and it will just
work.

This technique is called _polymorphism_, though no actual
shape-shifting is involved. Polymorphic code can _work with_ values of
different shape, as long as they expose the interface it expects.

== Laying out a table ==

I am going to work through a slightly more involved example in an
attempt to give you a better idea what polymorphism, as well as
object-oriented programming in general, looks like. The project is
this: We write a program that, given an array of arrays of table
cells, builds up a string that contains a nicely laid out
table—meaning that the columns are straight and the rows are aligned.
Something like this:

[source,text/plain]
----
name           height country
-------------- ------ -------------
Kilimanjaro      5895 Tanzania
Everest          8848 Nepal
Mount Fuji       3776 Japan
Mont Blanc       4808 Italy/France
Vaalserberg       323 Netherlands
Mount McKinley   6168 United States
Popocatepetl     5465 Mexico
----

The way our table-building system will work is that the builder
function lets the cells tell it how wide and high they want to be, and
then, once it has determined the width of the columns and the height
of the rows, asks them to draw themselves at the correct certain size
and assembles the result into a single string.

The interface through which the algorithm talks to the cells consists
of these methods:

* `minHeight()` returns a number indicating the minimum height this
  cell requires (in lines).

* `minWidth()` returns a number indicating its minimum width (in
  characters).

* `draw(width, height)` returns an array of strings with length
  `height`, each of them `width` characters wide. This represents the
  content of the cell.

I'm going to make heavy use of higher-order array methods in this
example, since it lends itself well to that approach.

The first part of the program computes arrays of minimum column widths
and row heights from a collection of cells.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function rowHeights(rows) {
  return rows.map(function(row) {
    return row.reduce(function(max, cell) {
      return Math.max(max, cell.minHeight());
    }, 0);
  });
}

function colWidths(rows) {
  return rows[0].map(function(_, i) {
    return rows.reduce(function(max, row) {
      return Math.max(max, row[i].minWidth());
    }, 0);
  });
}
----

The `rowHeights` function shouldn't be too hard to follow. It uses
`reduce` to compute the maximum height of an array of cells, and wraps
that in `map` in order to do it for all rows in the `rows` array.

(((map method)))(((filter method)))(((filter method)))Things are
slightly harder for the `colWidths` function, because the outer array
is an array of rows, not of columns. I have failed to mention so far
that `map` (as well as `forEach`, `filter`, and similar array methods)
pass a second argument to the function they get, which is the index of
the current element. By mapping over the elements of the first row,
and only using its second argument, `colWidths` builds up an array
with one element for every column index. The call to `reduce` runs
over the outer `rows` array again, and picks out the cell at the given
index from each row, maximizing their widths.

Using an underscore (`_`) as an argument name is a way to indicate (to
human readers) that this argument is not going to be used.

Drawing a table now looks like this:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function drawTable(rows) {
  var heights = rowHeights(rows);
  var widths = colWidths(rows);

  return rows.map(function(row, rowNum) {
    var blocks = row.map(function(cell, colNum) {
      return cell.draw(widths[colNum], heights[rowNum]);
    });
    return blocks[0].map(function(_, i) {
      return blocks.map(function(block) {
        return block[i];
      }).join(" ");
    }).join("\n");
  }).join("\n");
}
----

It repeatedly maps over things and then uses the array's `join` method
to build up a string from the result. The outer `map` call builds up
the strings for whole rows. Inside of it, a simple `map` is used to
get an array of text blocks for the cells in the row. We then have to
do another row-column inversion trick, similar to the one in
`colWidths`, to build up arrays of text for each line (the very inner
`map`/`join`), and then join these lines together with newline
characters.

Let us write a constructor for cells that contain text. The
constructor splits a string into an array of lines, and the `minWidth`
method finds the maximum line width in this array.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function repeat(string, times) {
  var result = "";
  for (var i = 0; i < times; i++)
    result += string;
  return result;
}

function TextCell(text) {
  this.text = text.split("\n");
}
TextCell.prototype.minWidth = function() {
  return this.text.reduce(function(width, line) {
    return Math.max(width, line.length);
  }, 0);
};
TextCell.prototype.minHeight = function() {
  return this.text.length;
}
TextCell.prototype.draw = function(width, height) {
  var result = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    var line = this.text[i] || "";
    result.push(line + repeat(" ", width - line.length));
  }
  return result;
};
----

The `repeat` function helps build up strings that repeat a single
character a given number of times. The `draw` method uses it to add
“padding” to lines, so that they all have the required length.

Let's try it out by building up a checkerboard.

[source,javascript]
----
var rows = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
   var row = [];
   for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
     if ((j + i) % 2 == 0)
       row.push(new TextCell("##"));
     else
       row.push(new TextCell("  "));
   }
   rows.push(row);
}
console.log(drawTable(rows));
// → ##    ##    ##
//      ##    ##   
//   ##    ##    ##
//      ##    ##   
//   ##    ##    ##
----

It works! But since all cells have the same size, it doesn't really do
anything interesting.

The source data for the table of mountains that we are trying to build
is available in the `MOUNTAINS` variable in the sandbox, and also
http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/mountains.js[downloadable] from the
list of data sets on the website!!tex  (`eloquentjavascript.net/code`)!!.

We will want to emphasize the top row, which contains the column
names, by underlining the cells with a series of dash characters. No
problem, we simply write a cell type that handles underlining.

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function UnderlinedCell(inner) {
  this.inner = inner;
};
UnderlinedCell.prototype.minWidth = function() {
  return this.inner.minWidth();
};
UnderlinedCell.prototype.minHeight = function() {
  return this.inner.minHeight() + 1;
};
UnderlinedCell.prototype.draw = function(width, height) {
  return this.inner.draw(width, height - 1)
    .concat([repeat("-", width)]);
};
----

An underlined cell _contains_ another cell. It report its minimum size
as being the same as that of its inner cell (by calling through to
that cell's `minWidth` and `minHeight` methods), but adds one to the
height, which is the space taken up by the underline.

Drawing such a cell is quite simple—we take the content of the inner
cell, and concatenate a single line full of dashes to it.

// test: wrap, trim

[source,javascript]
----
function dataTable(data) {
  var keys = Object.keys(data[0]);
  return [keys.map(function(name) {
    return new UnderlinedCell(new TextCell(name));
  })].concat(data.map(function(row) {
    return keys.map(function(name) {
      return new TextCell(String(row[name]));
    });
  }));
}

console.log(drawTable(dataTable(MOUNTAINS)));
// → name           height country
//   -------------- ------ -------------
//   Kilimanjaro    5895   Tanzania
//   … etcetera
----

Having an underlining mechanism, we can now write a function that
builds up a grid of cells from our data set. The standard
`Object.keys` function returns an array of property names in an
object. The top row of the table must contain underlined cells that
give the names of the columns. Below that, the values of all the
objects in the data set appear as normal cells—we extract them by
mapping over the `keys` array, so that we are sure that the order of
the cells is the same in every row.

== Getters and setters ==

(((getter)))(((setter)))(((property)))When specifying an interface, it
is possible to include properties that are not methods. We could have
defined `minHeight` and `minWidth` to simply hold numbers. But that'd
have required us to compute them in the constructor, which adds code
there that isn't strictly relevant to _constructing_ the object, and
it would cause problems if, for example, the inner cell of an
underlined cell was changed, at which point the size of the underlined
cell should also change.

This has led some people to adopt a principle of never including
non-method properties in interfaces. For things that behave as a
simple value property, which can be both read and written, they'd use
`getSomething` and `setSomething` methods which read and write the
property.

Fortunately, JavaScript allows a technique that gets us the best of
both worlds. We can specify properties that, from the outside, look
like normal properties, but secretly have methods associated with
them.

[source,javascript]
----
var pile = {
  elements: ["eggshell", "orange peel", "worm"],
  get height() {
    return this.elements.length;
  },
  set height(value) {
    console.log("Ignoring attempt to set height to",
                value);
  }
};

console.log(pile.height);
// → 3
pile.height = 100;
// → Ignoring attempt to set height to 100
----

(((defineProperty function)))In object expressions, putting `get` or
`set` in front of a property name allows you to specify a function to
be run when the property is read or written. You can also add such a
property to an existing object, for example a prototype, using the
`Object.defineProperty` function (which we also used to create
non-enumerable properties).

[source,javascript]
----
Object.defineProperty(TextCell.prototype, "heightProp", {
  get: function() { return this.text.length; }
});

console.log((new TextCell("no\nway")).heightProp);
// → 2
----

You can use a similar `set` property to specify a setter method. When
a getter but no setter is defined, writing to the property is simply
ignored.

== Inheritance ==

(((inheritance)))If you have paid close attention, you might have
noticed that we are not quite done yet with our table layout exercise.
It helps readability to right-align columns of numbers. We should
create another cell type that is like `TextCell`, but rather than
padding the lines on the right side, pads them on the left side, so
that they align to the right.

We could simply write a whole new constructor, with all three methods
in its prototype. But prototypes may themselves have prototypes, and
this allows us to do something clever:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function RTextCell(text) {
  TextCell.call(this, text);
}
RTextCell.prototype = Object.create(TextCell.prototype);
RTextCell.prototype.draw = function(width, height) {
  var result = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    var line = this.text[i] || "";
    result.push(repeat(" ", width - line.length) + line);
  }
  return result;
};
----

We reuse the constructor and the `minHeight` and `minWidth` methods
from the regular `TextCell`. An `RTextCell` is now basically
equivalent to a `TextCell`, except that its `draw` method contains a
different function.

This pattern is called _inheritance_. It allows us to build slightly
different data types from existing datatypes with relatively little
work. Typically, the new constructor will call the old constructor
(using the `call` method in order to be able to give it the new object
as its `this` value). Once this constructor has been called, we can
assume that all the fields that the old object type is supposed to
contain have been added. We arrange for the constructor's prototype to
derive from the old prototype, so that instances of this type will
also have access to the properties in that prototype. Finally, we can
override some of these properties by adding them to our new prototype.

Now if we slightly adjust the `dataTable` function to use
`RTextCell`'s for cells whose value is a number, we get the table we
were aiming for:

// include_code strip_log

[source,javascript]
----
function dataTable(data) {

Inheritance is a fundamental part of the object-oriented tradition,
alongside encapsulation and polymorphism. The latter two are now
generally regarded as wonderful ideas, whereas inheritance is somewhat
controversial.

(((polymorphism)))The main reason for this is that it is often
confused with polymorphism, sold as a more powerful tool than it
really is... and subsequently overused in all kinds of ugly ways.
Whereas encapsulation and polymorphism can be used to _separate_
pieces of code from each other, reducing the tangledness of the
overall program, inheritance fundamentally ties the types that inherit
from each other together, creating _more_ tangle.

(((composition)))You can have polymorphism without inheritance, as we
saw. I am not going to tell you to avoid inheritance—I use it
regularly in my own programs. But see it as a slightly dodgy trick
that can help you define new types with little code, not as a grand
principle of code organization. The way `UnderlinedCell` builds on
another cell object, by simply storing it in a property and forwarding
method calls to it in its own methods, is an alternative way to extend
types, and is usually preferable.

== The instanceof operator ==

(((instanceof operator)))(((constructor)))It is occasionally useful to
know whether an object was derived from a specific constructor. For
this, JavaScript provides a binary operator called `instanceof`:

[source,javascript]
----
console.log(new RTextCell("A") instanceof RTextCell);
// → true
console.log(new RTextCell("A") instanceof TextCell);
// → true
console.log(new TextCell("A") instanceof RTextCell);
// → false
console.log([1] instanceof Array);
// → true
----

The operator will also see through inherited types. An `RTextCell` is
an instance of `TextCell`, because `RTextCell.prototype` derives from
`TextCell.prototype`. The operator can be applied to standard
constructors like `Array`. Almost every object is an instance of
`Object`.

== Summary ==

(((prototype)))So objects are more complicated than I have been
letting on. They have prototypes, which are other objects, and will
act as if they have properties they don't have if the prototype has
that property. Simple objects will have `Object.prototype` as their
prototype.

(((constructor)))(((new operator)))(((instanceof
operator)))Constructors, which are functions whose name usually starts
with a capital letter, can be used with the `new` operator to create
new objects. The new object's prototype will be the `prototype`
property of the constructor function. You can do nice things with this
by putting the properties that all values of a given type share into
their prototype. The `instanceof` operator can, given an object and a
constructor, tell you whether that object is an instance of that
constructor.

(((encapsulation)))One useful thing to do with objects is to specify
an interface for them, and tell everybody that they are only supposed
to talk to your object through that interface (which consists of some
properties). The rest of the details that make up your object are now
_encapsulated_, hidden behind the interface.

(((polymorphism)))Once you are talking in terms of interfaces, who
says that only one kind of object may implement this interface? Having
different objects expose the same interface, and then writing code
that works on any object with the interface, is called _polymorphism_.
It is very useful.

(((inheritance)))When implementing multiple types that only differ in
some details, it can be helpful to simply make the prototype of your
new type derive from the prototype of your old type, and have your new
constructor call the old one. This gives you an object type very
similar to the old type, but in which you can add and override
properties as you see fit.

== Exercises ==

=== A point type ===

Write a constructor `Point` that represents a point in two-dimensional
space. It takes `x` and `y` parameters (numbers), which it saves to
properties by the same name.

Give the `Point` prototype two methods, `plus` and `minus`, which take
another point as a parameter, and return a new point that has the sum or
difference of the two points’ (the one in `this` and the parameter) x
and y coordinates.

Add a getter property `distance` to the prototype that computes the
distance of a point from the origin (0, 0).

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
// Your code here.

console.log(Point(1, 2).plus(Point(2, 3)));
// → Point{x: 3, y: 5}
console.log(Point(1, 2).minus(Point(2, 3)));
// → Point{x: -1, y: -1}
console.log(Point(3, 4).distance);
// → 5
----
endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

Your solution can follow the pattern of the `Rabbit` constructor from
this chapter quite closely.

(((Pythagoras)))Adding a getter property to the constructor can be
done with the `Object.defineProperty` function. To compute the
distance from (0, 0) to (x, y), we can use Pythagoras’ theorem, which
says that the square of the distance we are looking for is equal to
the square of the x coordinate plus the square of the y coordinate.
Thus √(x^2^ + y^2^) is the number we want, and `Math.sqrt` is the way
you compute a square root in JavaScript.

!!solution!!

=== Another cell ===

Implement a cell type (conforming to the table cell interface
described earlier in the chapter) `StretchCell(inner, width, height)`
that wraps another cell (like `UnderlinedCell` does), and ensures that
the resulting cell has at least the given `width` and `height`, even
if the inner cell would naturally be smaller.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
// Your code here.

var sc = new StretchCell(new TextCell("abc"), 1, 2);
console.log(sc.minWidth());
// → 3
console.log(sc.minHeight());
// → 2
console.log(sc.draw(3, 2));
// → ["abc", "   "]
----

endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

You'll have to store all three constructor arguments in the instance
object. The `minWidth` and `minHeight` methods call through to the
corresponding methods in the `inner` cell, but ensure that no number
less than the given size is returned (possibly using `Math.max`).

Don't forget to add a `draw` method that simply forwards the call to
the inner cell.

!!solution!!

=== Sequence interface ===

Design an interface that abstracts iteration over a collection of
values. Start by writing a `logFive` function that takes a sequence
object and calls `console.log` on its first five elements—or less, if
the sequence has less than five elements.

Then implement an object type `ArraySeq` that wraps an array and
allows iteration over the array using the interface you designed.
Implement another object type `RangeSeq` that iterates over a range of
integers (taking `from` and `to` arguments to its constructor)
instead.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
// Your code here.

logFive(new ArraySeq([1, 2]));
// → 1
// → 2
logFive(new RangeSeq(100, 1000));
// → 100
// → 101
// → 102
// → 103
// → 104
----

endif::html_target[]

!!solution!!

The most obvious way to solve this is to give the sequence objects
_state_, meaning their properties are changed in the process of using
them. You could store a counter in them that indicates how far they
have advanced.

Your interface will need to expose at least a way to get the next
element, and to find out whether the iteration has reached the end of
the sequence yet. It is tempting to roll these into one method,
`next`, which returns `null` or `undefined` when the sequence is at
its end. But now you have a problem when a sequence actually contains
`null`. So a separate method (or getter property) to find out whether
the end is reached is probably preferable.

Another solution is to avoid changing state in the object, and expose
methods for getting the current element (without advancing any
counter), and for getting a new sequence that represents the remaining
elements after the current one (or a special value if the end of the
sequence is reached). This is quite elegant—a sequence value will
“stay itself” even after it is used, and can thus be shared with other
code without worrying about what might happen to it. It is,
unfortunately, also very inefficient in a language like JavaScript,
because it involves creating a lot of objects during iteration.
