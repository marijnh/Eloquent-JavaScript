# Eloquent JavaScript

These are the sources used to build the second edition of Eloquent
JavaScript.

The rewrite is a work in progress. Feedback welcome, in the form of
issues and pull requests, but don't waste too much time on detailed
correction of the current content yet, since large chunks might still
be overhauled in the near future.

## Building

    npm install
    apt-get install asciidoc
    make html
    # and optionally
    apt-get install dblatex
    make tex
