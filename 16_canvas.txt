= Drawing on Canvas =

[quote,M.C. Escher,cited by Bruno Ernst in The Magic Mirror of M.C. Escher]
____
Drawing is deception
____

Browsers provide several ways to create graphics. The simplest
approach is to use regular DOM elements, and use styles to position
and color them. This can get us quite far, as the previous chapter
showed. By adding partially transparent background images to the
nodes, we can make then look exactly the way we want to. It is even
possible to rotate or skew nodes by using the `transform` style.

But we'd be using the DOM for something that it wasn't originally
designed for. There are things, like drawing a line between arbitrary
points, that are extremely awkward to do with regular HTML elements.

There are two alternatives. The first is DOM-based, but utilizing
_SVG_, rather than HTML elements, which you can think of as a
different dialect for describing documents, one that focuses on shapes
rather than text. An SVG document can be embedded inside an HTML
document, but also included through an `<img>` tag.

The second alternative is called a _canvas_. A canvas is a single DOM
node that encapsulates a whole picture. It provides a programming
interface for drawing shapes onto the space taken up by the node. The
main difference between a canvas and an SVG picture is that in SVG,
the original description of the shapes is preserved, so that they can
be moved or resized at any time. Canvas, on the other hand, converts
the shapes to pixels (colored dots on a raster) as soon as they are
drawn, and does not remember what these pixels represent. The only way
to move a shape on a canvas is to clear the canvas (or the area around
the shape) and redraw it with the shape in its new position.

== SVG ==

This book not go into SVG in detail, but I will briefly try to explain
how it works. At the end of the chapter, I'll come back to the
trade-offs that must be considered when deciding which drawing
mechanism is the most appropriate for a given application.

This is an HTML document with a simple SVG picture inside of it:

[sandbox="svg"]
[source,text/html]
----
<p>Normal HTML here.</p>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle r="50" cx="50" cy="50" fill="red"/>
  <rect x="120" y="5" width="90" height="90"
        stroke="blue" fill="none"/>
</svg>
----

The `xmlns` attribute changes a node (and its children) to a different
_XML namespace_. This namespace, identified by a URL, specifies the
dialect that we are currently speaking. The `<circle>` and `<rect>`
tags, which do not exist in HTML, do have a meaning in SVG—they draw
shapes, using the style and position specified by their attributes.

These tags create DOM elements, just like HTML tags. For example, this
changes the `<circle>` element to be colored cyan instead:

[sandbox="svg"]
[source,javascript]
----
var circle = document.querySelector("circle");
circle.setAttribute("fill", "cyan");
----

You can even register mouse event handler on such elements.

== The canvas element ==

Canvas graphics can be drawn onto a `<canvas>` tag. You can give such
an element `width` and `height` attributes to determine its size, in
pixels.

A new canvas is empty, meaning it is entirely transparent, and thus
shows up simply as empty space in the document.

The canvas tag is intended to support different styles of drawing. To
get access to an actual drawing interface, we first need to create a
_context_, which is an object whose methods provide the drawing
interface. There are currently two widely supported drawing styles,
`"2d"` for two-dimensional graphics, and `"webgl"` for
three-dimensional graphics through the widely used OpenGL interface.

This book won't discuss WebGL. We stick to two dimensions. But if you
are interested in three-dimensional graphics, do look into WebGL. It
provides a very direct interface to modern graphics hardware, and thus
allows you to render even complicated scenes very efficiently—from
JavaScript.

A context is created through the `getContext` method on the `<canvas>`
element.

[source,text/html]
----
<p>Before canvas.</p>
<canvas width="120" height="60"></canvas>
<p>After canvas.</p>
<script>
  var canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
  var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
  context.fillStyle = "red";
  context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 50);
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_fill.png[alt="A canvas with a rectangle"]

endif::tex_target[]

After creating the context object, the example draws a red rectangle
100 pixels wide and 50 pixels high, with its top left corner at
coordinates _10,10_.

Just like in HTML (and SVG), the coordinate system that the canvas
uses puts _0,0_ at the top left corner, and the positive y axis goes
down from there, so _10,10_ is ten pixels below and to the right of
at corner.

== Filling and stroking ==

In the terminology used by the canvas interface (as well as by SVG),
there are two things that can be done with a shape. It can be either
_filled_, meaning its area is given a certain color (or pattern), or
it can be _stroked_, which means a line is drawn along its edge.

The `fillRect` method fills a rectangle. It takes first the x and y
coordinates of the rectangle's top left corner, then its width, and
then its height. A similar method, `strokeRect`, draws the outline of
a rectangle.

Neither of these methods take any parameters beyond the dimensions of
the rectangle. The way in which the filling or stroking happens is not
determined by an argument to the method (as you might justly expect),
but rather by properties of the drawing context object.

Setting `fillStyle` changes the way shapes are filled. It can be set
to a string that specifies a color (any color understood by CSS can
also be used here).

The `strokeStyle` property work similarly, but determines the color
used for a stroked line. The width of that line is determined by the
`lineWidth` property, which may contain any positive number.

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.strokeStyle = "blue";
  cx.strokeRect(5, 5, 50, 50);
  cx.lineWidth = 5;
  cx.strokeRect(135, 5, 50, 50);
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_stroke.png[alt="Two stroked squares"]

endif::tex_target[]

When no `width` or `height` attributes are specified, the canvas will
get a default width of 300 and height of 150 pixels.

== Paths ==

A path is a sequence of lines. The 2d canvas interface's approach to
describing such a path is rather peculiar. It is done entirely through
side effects.

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  for (var y = 10; y < 100; y += 10) {
    cx.moveTo(10, y);
    cx.lineTo(90, y);
  }
  cx.stroke();
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_path.png[alt="Stroking a number of lines"]

endif::tex_target[]

The example creates a path with a number of horizontal line segments,
and then strokes it using the `stroke` method. Each segment created
with `lineTo` starts at the path's _current_ position, which is the
end of the last segment, unless that position was moved using
`moveTo`.

When filling a path (using the `fill` method), each shape is filled
separately. A path can contain multiple shapes—each `moveTo` motion
starts a new one. If the path is not already _closed_ (its start and
end are in different positions), a line is added from its end to its
start, and the shape enclosed by the resulting line is filled.

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  cx.moveTo(50, 10);
  cx.lineTo(10, 70);
  cx.lineTo(90, 70);
  cx.fill();
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_triangle.png[alt="Filling a path"]

endif::tex_target[]

This draws a filled triangle. Note that only two of the triangle's
sides are explicitly drawn. The third, from the bottom right corner
back to the top, is implied, and won't be there when we stroke the
path.

The `closePath` method explicitly closes a path by adding an actual
line segment back to its start. This segment _is_ drawn when stroking
the path.

== Curves ==

A path may also contain curved lines. These are, unfortunately, a bit
more involved to draw than straight lines.

The `quadraticCurveTo` method draws a curve to a given point. To
determine the curvature of the line, it is given a control point as
well as a destination point. You can imagine this control point as
_attracting_ the line, giving it its curve. The line won't go through
the control point. Rather, the direction of the line at its start and
end point will be such that it aligns with the line from there to the
control point. The following picture illustrates this:

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  cx.moveTo(10, 90);
  // control=(60,10) goal=(90,90)
  cx.quadraticCurveTo(60, 10, 90, 90);
  cx.lineTo(60, 10);
  cx.closePath();
  cx.stroke();
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_quadraticcurve.png[alt="A quadratic curve"]

endif::tex_target[]

We draw a quadratic curve from the left to the right, with _60,10_ as
control point, and then draw two line segments, going through that
control point and back to the start of the line. The result somewhat
resembles a Star Trek insignia. You can see the effect of the control
point: the lines leaving the lower corners start off in the direction
of the control point, and then curve towards their target.

A similar kind of curve is drawn with `bezierCurve`. Instead of a
single control point, this one has two—one for each end of the line.
Here is a similar sketch to illustrates the behavior of such a curve:

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  cx.moveTo(10, 90);
  // control1=(10,10) control2=(90,10) goal=(50,90)
  cx.bezierCurveTo(10, 10, 90, 10, 50, 90);
  cx.lineTo(90, 10);
  cx.lineTo(10, 10);
  cx.closePath();
  cx.stroke();
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_beziercurve.png[alt="A bezier curve"]

endif::tex_target[]

The two control points specify the direction at both ends of the curve.
The further they are away from their corresponding point, the more the
curve will “bulge” in that direction.

Such curves are unfortunately not very easy to work with—finding the
control points that provide the shape you are looking for can be
difficult. Sometimes you can find a way to compute them, and sometimes
you'll just have to find a suitable value by trial and error.

Easier to reason about are __arcs__—fragments of a circle. The `arcTo`
method method takes no less than five arguments. The first four act
somewhat like the arguments to ++quadraticCurveTo++—the first two are
a sort of control point, and the second two are the line's
destination. The fifth argument provides the radius of the arc. The
method will conceptually take a corner, a line going to the control
point and then the destination point, and round its point so that it
forms part of a circle with the given radius. It then draws this
rounded part, as well as a line from the starting position to the
start of the rounded part.

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  cx.moveTo(10, 10);
  // control=(90,10) goal=(90,90) radius=20
  cx.arcTo(90, 10, 90, 90, 20);
  cx.moveTo(10, 10);
  // control=(90,10) goal=(90,90) radius=80
  cx.arcTo(90, 10, 90, 90, 80);
  cx.stroke();
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_arc.png[alt="Two arcs with different radii"]

endif::tex_target[]

The `arcTo` method will not draw the line from the end of the rounded
part to the goal position, though the word “to” in its name would
suggest it does. You can follow up with a call to `lineTo` with the
same goal coordinates to add that part of the line.

To draw a circle, you could use four calls to `arcTo` (each turning 90
degrees). But the `arc` method provides a simpler way. It takes a pair
of coordinates for the arc's center, a radius, and then a start and
end angle.

Those last two parameters make it possible to draw only a part of
circle. The angles are measured in radians, not degrees. This means
that a full circle has an angle of 2π (`2 * Math.PI`, about 6.28). The
angle starts counting at the point to the right of the circle's
center, and goes clockwise from there. You can use a start of zero and
an end bigger than 2π (say, 7) to draw a full circle.

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  // center=(50,50) radius=40 angle=0 to 7
  cx.arc(50, 50, 40, 0, 7);
  // center=(150,50) radius=40 angle=0 to ½π
  cx.arc(150, 50, 40, 0, 0.5 * Math.PI);
  cx.stroke();
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_circle.png[alt="Drawing a circle"]

endif::tex_target[]

The resulting picture contains a line from the left of the full circle
(first call to `arc`) to the left of the quarter-circle (second call).
Like other path drawing methods, a line drawn with `arc` is connected
to the previous path segment by default. You'd have to call `moveTo`
(or start a new path) if you want to avoid this.

== Drawing a smooth line ==

Imagine you've just taken a job at EconomiCorp Inc., and your first
assignment is to draw a pie chart of their customer satisfaction
survey results.

The `results` variable contains an array of objects that represent the
survey responses:

// include_code

[sandbox="pie"]
[source,javascript]
----
var results = [
  {name: "Satisfied", count: 1043, color: "lightblue"},
  {name: "Neutral", count: 563, color: "lightgreen"},
  {name: "Unsatisfied", count: 510, color: "pink"},
  {name: "No comment", count: 175, color: "silver"}
];
----

To draw a pie chart, we draw a number of pie slices, made up of an
arc, and a pair of lines to the center of that arc. We can compute the
angle taken up by each arc by dividing a full circle (2π) by the total
number of responses, and then multiplying that number (the angle per
response) by the amount of people that picked a given choice.

[sandbox="pie"]
[source,text/html]
----
<canvas width="200" height="200"></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  var total = results.reduce(function(sum, choice) {
    return sum + choice.count;
  }, 0);
  // Start at the top
  var currentAngle = -0.5 * Math.PI;
  results.forEach(function(result) {
    var sliceAngle = (result.count / total) * 2 * Math.PI;
    cx.beginPath();
    // center=100,100, radius=100
    cx.arc(100, 100, 100,
    // from current angle, clockwise by slice's angle
           currentAngle, currentAngle + sliceAngle);
    currentAngle += sliceAngle;
    cx.lineTo(100, 100);
    cx.fillStyle = result.color;
    cx.fill();
  });
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_pie_chart.png[alt="A pie chart"]

endif::tex_target[]

A pie chart that doesn't tell us what the slices mean is not very
helpful. We would like to have a way to draw text to the canvas.

== Text ==

A 2d canvas drawing context provides the methods `fillText` and
`strokeText`. The latter can be used for outlining letters, but
usually `fillText` is what you want. It will fill the given text with
the current `fillColor`.

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.font = "28px Georgia";
  cx.fillStyle = "fuchsia";
  cx.fillText("I can draw text, too!", 10, 50);
</script>
----

The size, style, and font of the text can be specified using the
`font` property. The example gives just a font size and family name.
You can add `italic` or `bold` to the start of the string to select a
style.

The last two arguments to `fillText` (and `strokeText`) provide the
position at which the font is drawn. By default, they indicate the
position of the start of the text's alphabetic baseline (the line on
which the letters “stand”, not counting hanging parts in letters like
“j” or “p”). The horizontal position can be changed by setting the
`textAlign` property to `"end"` or `"center"`, the vertical position
by setting `textBaseline` to `"top"`, `"middle"`, or `"bottom"`.

We will come back to our pie chart, and the problem of labeling the
slices, in the exercises at the end of the chapter.

== Images ==

In computer graphics, a distinction is often made between _vector_
graphics and _bitmap_ graphics. The first is what we have been doing
so far in this chapter—specifying a picture by giving a logical
description of shapes. Bitmap graphics, on the other hand, don't
specify actual shapes but rather work with pixel data (rasters of
colored dots).

The `drawImage` method allows us to draw pixel data onto a canvas.
This pixel data can originate from an `<img>` element or from another
canvas (neither have to be visible in the actual document). The
example below creates a detached `<img>` element and loads an image
file into it. But it can not immediately start drawing from this
picture, because the browser may not have fetched it yet. To deal with
this, we register a `"load"` event handler, and do the drawing after
the image has loaded.

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  var img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = "img/hat.png";
  img.addEventListener("load", function() {
    for (var x = 10; x < 200; x += 30)
      cx.drawImage(img, x, 10);
  });
</script>
----

By default, `drawImage` will draw the image at its original size. You
can give it two additional arguments to determine the width and height
with which it is drawn.

When `drawImage` is given _nine_ arguments, it can be used to draw
only a fragment of an image. The second to fifth argument indicate the
rectangle (x, y, width, and height) in the source image that should be
copied, and the sixth to ninth argument give the rectangle (on the
canvas) into which it should be copied.

This can be used to pack multiple _sprites_ (image elements) into a
single image file, and then copy out the part you need. For example,
we have this picture containing a game character in multiple poses.

// FIXME update with new art

image::img/player.png[alt="Various poses of a game character"]

If we alternate which pose we draw, we can show an animation that
looks like a walking character.

To animate the picture on a canvas, the `clearRect` method is useful.
It resembles `fillRect`, but instead of coloring the rectangle, it
resets it back to transparent.

We know that each _sprite_, each sub-picture, is 16 pixels wide and 30
pixels high. The code below loads the image, and then sets up an
interval (repeated timer) to draw the next frame.

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  var img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = "img/player.png";
  var spriteW = 16, spriteH = 30;
  img.addEventListener("load", function() {
    var cycle = 0;
    setInterval(function() {
      cx.clearRect(0, 0, spriteW, spriteH);
      cx.drawImage(img,
                   // source rectangle
                   cycle * spriteW, 0, spriteW, spriteH,
                   // destination rectangle
                   0,               0, spriteW, spriteH);
      cycle = (cycle + 1) % 8;
    }, 120);
  });
</script>
----

The `cycle` variable tracks our position in the animation. Each frame,
it is incremented and then clipped back to the 0 to 7 range by using
the remainder operator. This variable is then used to compute the x
coordinate that the sprite for the current posture has in the picture.

== Transformation ==

But what if we want our character to walk to the left instead of to
the right? We could add another set of sprites, of course. But we can
also instruct the canvas to draw the picture the other way round.

Calling the `scale` method will cause anything drawn after it to be
scaled. It takes two parameters, one to set a horizontal scale and one
to set a vertical scale.

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.scale(3, .5);
  cx.beginPath();
  cx.arc(50, 50, 40, 0, 7);
  cx.lineWidth = 3;
  cx.stroke();
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_scale.png[alt="A scaled circle"]

endif::tex_target[]

Scaling will cause everything about the drawn image, including the
line width, to be stretched out or squeezed together as specified.
Scaling by a negative amount will flip the picture around. The
flipping happens around point _0,0_, which means that it will also
flip the direction of the coordinate system. When a horizontal scaling
of -1 is applied, a shape drawn at x position 100 will end up at what
used to be position -100.

So to turn a picture around, we can not simply add `cx.scale(-1, 1)`
before the call to `drawImage`, since that would move our picture
outside of the canvas, where it won't be visible.

One way to fix this is by adjusting the coordinates given to
`drawImage` to compensate for this (by drawing it at x position -50
instead of 0). Another way, which requires less changes to other code,
is to adjust the axis around which the scaling happens.

There are several other methods, besides `scale` that influence the
coordinate system for a canvas. It can be rotated with the `rotate`
method, and moved with the `translate` method. The interesting— and
confusing—thing is that these transformations _stack_, meaning that
each one happens relative to the previous transformations.

So if we translate (move) by 10 horizontal pixels twice, everything
will be drawn 20 pixels to the right. If we first move the center of
the coordinate system to _50,50_ and then rotate by 20 degrees (0.1π
in radians), that rotation will happen around point _50,50_.

image::img/transform.svg[alt="Stacking transformations"]

But if, instead, we first rotated by 20 degrees, and then translated
by _50,50_, the translation will happen in the rotated coordinate
system, and thus produce a different orientation. The order in which
transformations are applied matters.

To flip a picture around the vertical line at a given x position, we
can do the following:

// include_code

[source,javascript]
----
function flipHorizontally(context, around) {
  context.translate(around, 0);
  context.scale(-1, 1);
  context.translate(-around, 0);
}
----

We first move the y axis to where we want our mirror to be, then apply
the mirroring, and finally move the y axis back to its proper place in
the mirrored universe. The picture below tries to explain why this
works.

image::img/mirror.svg[alt="Mirroring around a vertical line"]

This shows the coordinate systems, before and after mirroring in the
central line. If we draw a triangle at a positive x position, it
would, by default, be in the place where triangle 1 is. A call to
`flipHorizontally` first does a translation to the right, which gets
us to triangle 2. It then scales, flipping the triangle back to
position 3. This is not where it should be, if it were mirrored in the
given line. The second `translate` call fixes this—it “cancels” the
initial translation, and makes triangle 4 appear exactly where it
should.

We can now draw a mirrored character at position _100,0_ by flipping
the world around the character's vertical center:

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  var img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = "img/player.png";
  var spriteW = 16, spriteH = 30;
  img.addEventListener("load", function() {
    flipHorizontally(cx, 100 + spriteW / 2);
    cx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, spriteW, spriteH,
                 100, 0, spriteW, spriteH);
  });
</script>
----

== Storing and clearing transformations ==

Transformations stick around. Everything else we draw after drawing
that mirrored character would also be mirrored. That might be a
problem.

The `resetTransform` method (which takes no arguments) clears the
canvas’ transformations entirely. It is also possible to save the
current transformation, do some drawing and transforming, and then
restore the old transformation. This is usually the proper thing to do
for a function that needs to temporarily transform the coordinate
system: first save whatever the code that called the function was
using, then do its thing (on top of the existing transformation), and
then revert to what it started with.

The `save` and `restore` methods on the 2d canvas context perform this
kind of transformation tracking. They conceptually maintain a stack of
transformation states. When you call `save`, the current state is
pushed onto the stack, and when you call `restore`, the state on top
of the stack is taken off, and used as the context's current
transformation.

The example below illustrates what you can do with a function that
changes the transformation and then calls another function (in this
case itself), which continues drawing with the given transformation.

The `branch` function draws a tree-like shape by first drawing a line,
and then moving the coordinate system to the end of the line and
calling itself twice, first rotated to the left, and then rotated to
the right. Every call reduces the length of the branch drawn, and the
recursion stops when the length drops below 8.

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas width="600" height="300"></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  function branch(length, angle, scale) {
    cx.fillRect(0, 0, 1, length);
    if (length < 8) return;
    cx.save();
    cx.translate(0, length);
    cx.rotate(-angle);
    branch(length * scale, angle, scale);
    cx.rotate(2 * angle);
    branch(length * scale, angle, scale);
    cx.restore();
  }
  cx.translate(300, 0);
  branch(60, 0.5, 0.8);
</script>
----

ifdef::tex_target[]

image::img/canvas_tree.png[alt="A recursive picture"]

endif::tex_target[]

If the calls to `save` and `restore` were not there, the second
recursive call to `branch` would end up with the position and rotation
created by the first call—it would not be connected to the current
branch, but rather to the innermost, rightmost branch drawn by the first
call. The resulting shape might also be interesting, but it is
definitely not a tree.

== Back to the game ==

We now know enough about canvas drawing to start working on the
canvas-based display system for the game from the last chapter. The
new display will no longer be showing just colored boxes. Instead,
we'll use `drawImage` to draw the game's elements.

We must define an object type `CanvasDisplay`, supporting the same
interface as `DOMDisplay` from Chapter 15 (methods `drawFrame` and
`clear`).

This object keeps a little more information that `DOMDisplay`. Rather
than using the scroll position of its DOM element, it tracks its own view
port, which tells us what part of the level we are currently looking
at. It also tracks time, and uses that to decide which animation frame
to use. And finally, it keeps a `flipPlayer` property, so that even
when the player is standing still, they keep facing the direction they
last moved in.

// include_code

[sandbox="game"]
[source,javascript]
----
function CanvasDisplay(parent, level) {
  this.canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
  this.canvas.width = 600;
  this.canvas.height = 450;
  parent.appendChild(this.canvas);
  this.cx = this.canvas.getContext("2d");

  this.level = level;
  this.animationTime = 0;
  this.flipPlayer = false;

  this.viewport = {
    left: 0,
    top: 0,
    width: this.canvas.width / scale,
    height: this.canvas.height / scale
  };

  this.drawFrame(0);
}

CanvasDisplay.prototype.clear = function() {
  this.canvas.parentNode.removeChild(this.canvas);
};
----

The `animationTime` counter is the reason we passed the step size to
`drawFrame` in Chapter 15, even though `DOMDisplay` does not use it.
Our new `drawFrame` function uses it to keep track of the time the
game has been running (in seconds).

// include_code

[sandbox="game"]
[source,javascript]
----
CanvasDisplay.prototype.drawFrame = function(step) {
  this.animationTime += step;

  this.updateViewport();
  this.clearDisplay();
  this.drawBackground();
  this.drawActors();
};
----

Other than that, the method updates the viewport for the current
player position, clears the whole canvas, and draws the background and
actors onto that. Note that this is different from the approach in
Chapter 15, where we drew the background once and scrolled the
wrapping DOM element to move it.

Because shapes on a canvas are just pixels, after we draw them, there
is no way to move them (or remove them). In most cases, the only way
to update a canvas display is to clear it and redraw the scene.

The `updateViewport` method is very similar to `DOMDisplay`'s
`scrollPlayerIntoView` method. It checks whether the player is too
close to the edge of the screen, and moves the viewport when this is
the case.

// include_code

[sandbox="game"]
[source,javascript]
----
CanvasDisplay.prototype.updateViewport = function() {
  var view = this.viewport, margin = view.width / 3;
  var player = this.level.player;
  var center = player.pos.plus(player.size.times(0.5));

  if (center.x < view.left + margin)
    view.left = Math.max(center.x - margin, 0);
  else if (center.x > view.left + view.width - margin)
    view.left = Math.min(center.x + margin - view.width,
                         this.level.width - view.width);
  if (center.y < view.top + margin)
    view.top = Math.max(center.y - margin, 0);
  else if (center.y > view.top + view.height - margin)
    view.top = Math.min(center.y + margin - view.height,
                        this.level.height - view.height);
};
----

The calls to `Math.max` and `Math.min` are used to ensure that the
viewport does not end up showing space outside of the level.
`Math.max(x, 0)` has the effect of ensuring the resulting number is
not less than zero. `Math.min`, similarly, ensures a value stays below
a given bound.

When clearing the display, we'll use a slightly different color
depending on whether the game is won (brighter) or lost (darker).

// include_code

[sandbox="game"]
[source,javascript]
----
CanvasDisplay.prototype.clearDisplay = function() {
  if (this.level.status == "won")
    this.cx.fillStyle = "rgb(68, 191, 255)";
  else if (this.level.status == "lost")
    this.cx.fillStyle = "rgb(44, 136, 214)";
  else
    this.cx.fillStyle = "rgb(52, 166, 251)";
  this.cx.fillRect(0, 0,
                   this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);
};
----

To draw the background, we run through the tiles that are visible in
the current viewport, using the same trick used in `obstacleAt` in the
previous chapter.

// include_code

[sandbox="game"]
[source,javascript]
----
var otherSprites = document.createElement("img");
otherSprites.src = "img/sprites.png";

CanvasDisplay.prototype.drawBackground = function() {
  var view = this.viewport;
  var xStart = Math.floor(view.left);
  var xEnd = Math.ceil(view.left + view.width);
  var yStart = Math.floor(view.top);
  var yEnd = Math.ceil(view.top + view.height);

  for (var y = yStart; y < yEnd; y++) {
    for (var x = xStart; x < xEnd; x++) {
      var tile = this.level.grid[y][x];
      if (tile == null) continue;
      var screenX = (x - view.left) * scale;
      var screenY = (y - view.top) * scale;
      var tilePos = tile == "lava" ? scale : 0;
      this.cx.drawImage(otherSprites,
                        tilePos,       0, scale, scale,
                        screenX, screenY, scale, scale);
    }
  }
};
----

Tiles that are not empty (null) are drawn with `drawImage`. The
`otherSprites` image contains the pictures used for the elements that
are not the player. It contains, from left to right, the wall tile,
the lava tile, and then the sprite for a coin. 

image::img/sprites_background.png[alt="Sprites for our game"]

Background tiles are 20 by 20 pixels, since we will use the same scale
that we used in `DOMDisplay`. Thus, the offset for lava tiles is 20
(the value of the `scale` variable), and the offset for walls is zero.

We do not bother waiting for the sprite image to load in this program.
Calling `drawImage` with an image that hasn't been loaded yet will
simply do nothing. Thus, we might fail to draw the game properly for
the first few frames, while the image is still loading, but that is
not a serious problem. Since we keep updating the screen, the correct
scene will appear as soon as the loading finishes.

The walking character we used before will be used to represent the
player. The code that draws it needs to pick the right sprite and
direction based on the player's current motion. When the player is
standing still, we draw the leftmost sprite. During jumps (when the
vertical speed is not zero), we use the rightmost sprite. When
walking, we cycle through the first 8 sprites based on the display's
`animationTime` property. This is measured in seconds, and we want to
switch frames twelve times per second, so the time is multiplied by 12
first.

// include_code

[sandbox="game"]
[source,javascript]
----
var playerSprites = document.createElement("img");
playerSprites.src = "img/player.png";

CanvasDisplay.prototype.drawPlayer = function(x, y, width,
                                              height) {
  var sprite = 0, player = this.level.player;
  if (player.speed.x)
    this.flipPlayer = player.speed.x < 0;

  if (player.speed.y)
    sprite = 8;
  else if (player.speed.x)
    sprite = Math.floor(this.animationTime * 12) % 8;

  if (this.flipPlayer)
    flipHorizontally(this.cx, x + width / 2);

  this.cx.drawImage(playerSprites,
                    sprite * width, 0, width, height,
                    x,              y, width, height);

  if (this.flipPlayer)
    this.cx.resetTransform();
};
----

We use `resetTransform` instead of `save` and `restore`, because our
drawing system will not use transformations in any other places, and
thus there is no transformation to save.

The function above is called by `drawActors`, which is responsible for
drawing the all the actors in the game.

// include_code

[sandbox="game"]
[source,javascript]
----
CanvasDisplay.prototype.drawActors = function() {
  this.level.actors.forEach(function(actor) {
    var width = actor.size.x * scale;
    var height = actor.size.y * scale;
    var x = (actor.pos.x - this.viewport.left) * scale;
    var y = (actor.pos.y - this.viewport.top) * scale;
    if (actor.type == "player") {
      this.drawPlayer(x, y, width, height);
    } else {
      var tile = (actor.type == "coin" ? 2 : 1) * scale;
      this.cx.drawImage(otherSprites,
                        tile, 0, width, height,
                        x,    y, width, height);
    }
  }, this);
};
----

When drawing something that is not the player, we look at its type to
find the offset of the correct sprite. The lava tile is found at
offset 20, and the coin sprite at 40 (two times `scale`).

We have to subtract the viewport's position when computing the actor's
position, since _0,0_ on our canvas corresponds to the top left of the
viewport, not the top left of the level. We could also have used
`translate` for this. Either way works.

== Choosing a graphics interface ==

Any time you want to generate graphics in the browser, you must choose
between plain HTML, SVG, and canvas. There is no single _best_
approach that works in all situations. Each option has strengths and
weaknesses.

Plain HTML has the advantage of being simple. It also integrates well
with text. Both SVG and canvas allow you to draw text, but won't help
with positioning that text, or wrapping it when it takes up more than
one line. In an HTML-based picture, it is very easy to include blocks
of text.

SVG can be used to produce crisp graphics that look good at any zoom
level. It is more difficult to use than plain HTML, but also much more
powerful.

Both SVG and HTML build up a data structure (the DOM) that represents
the picture. This makes it possible to modify elements they are drawn.
If you need to repeatedly change a small part of a big picture, in
response to what the user is doing or as part of an animation, doing
it in canvas can be needlessly expensive. The DOM also allows us to
register mouse event handlers on every element in the picture (even on
shapes drawn with SVG). This can not be done with canvas.

But canvas’ pixel-oriented approach can be an advantage when drawing a
huge amount of tiny elements. The fact that it does not build up a
data structure, but only repeatedly draws onto the same pixel surface,
can make it faster in situations like that.

There are also effects, such as rendering a scene one pixel at a time
(for example with a ray tracer), or post-processing an image with
JavaScript (blurring or distorting it) that can only be realistically
handled by a pixel-based technique.

In some cases, it is worthwhile to combine several of these
techniques. For example, drawing a graph with SVG or canvas, but
showing textual information, when the user clicks or hovers over an
element, by positioning an HTML element on top of the picture.

For non-demanding applications, it really does not matter much which
interface you choose. The second display we built for our game in this
chapter could have been implemented using any of these thee graphics
technologies. It does not need to draw text, handle mouse interaction,
or work with an extraordinarily large amount of elements.

== Summary ==

In this chapter, we discussed techniques for drawing graphics in the
browser, focusing on the `<canvas>` element.

A canvas node represents an area in a document that our program may
draw on. This drawing is done through a drawing context object,
created with the `getContext` method.

The 2d drawing interface allows us to fill and stroke various shapes.
The way shapes are filled is determined by the context's `fillStyle`
property. The way lines are drawn is controlled by the `strokeStyle`
and `lineWidth` properties.

Rectangles and pieces of text can be drawn with a single method call
(`fillRect`, and `strokeRect`, or `fillText` and `strokeText` for
text). To create more complicated shapes, we must first build up a
path.

Calling `beginPath` starts a new path. A number of other methods add
lines and curves to the current path, for example `lineTo` can be used
to add a straight line. When a path is finished, it can be filled with
the `fill` method or stroked with the `stroke` method.

Moving pixels from an image or another canvas onto our canvas is done
with the `drawImage` method. By default, this method draws the whole
source image, but by giving it more parameters it scan be made to copy
out a specific area. We used this for our game, by copying individual
postures of the game character out of an image that contained many
such postures.

To draw a shape in multiple orientations, transformations can be used.
A 2d drawing context has a current transformation that can be changed
with the `translate`, `scale`, and `rotate` methods. These will affect
all subsequent drawing operations, until the transformation is reset
with `resetTransform`.

When drawing an animation onto a canvas, it the `clearRect` method can
be used to clear a part of the canvas, before redrawing it.

== Exercises ==

=== Shapes ===

Write a program that draws shapes resembling the following, next to
each other on a canvas:

1. A parallelogram (a rectangle that is wider on one side).

2. A red diamond (a rectangle rotated 45 degrees or ¼π radians).

3. A zigzagging line.

4. A spiral made up of 100 straight line segments.

5. A yellow star.

image::img/exercise_shapes.png[alt="The shapes to draw"]

When drawing the latter two, you may want to refer back to the
explanation of using `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` to get coordinates on a
circle, from Chapter 13.

I recommend creating a function for each shape, and passing the
position, and optionally other things, such as the size or the number
of points, as parameters. The alternative, which is to “hard-code”
numbers all over your code, tends to make the code hard to read and
modify.

<canvas width="600" height="200"></canvas>

  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");

  // Your code here.

!!solution!!

1. The parallelogram is easy to draw using a path. Pick suitable
   center coordinates, and add each of the four corners around that.

2. The diamond can be drawn the easy way, with a path, or the
   interesting way, with a `rotate` transformation. To use rotation,
   you will have to apply a trick similar to what we did in the
   `flipHorizontally` function. Because you want to rotate around the
   center of your rectangle, and not around the point _0,0_, you must
   first `translate` to there, then rotate, and then translate back.

3. For the zigzag it becomes unpractical to write a new call to
   `lineTo` for each line segment. Instead you should use a loop. You
   can either have each iteration draw two line segments (right and
   then left again), or one, in which case you must use the evenness
   (`% 2`) of the loop index to determine whether to go left or right.

4. You'll also need a loop for the spiral. If you draw a series of
   points, with each point moving further along a circle around the
   spiral's center, you get a circle. If, during the loop, you vary
   the radius of the circle on which you are putting the current
   point, and go around more than once, the result is a spiral.

5. The star depicted is built out of `quadraticCurveTo` lines. You
   could also draw one with straight lines. Divide a circle into 8 (or
   however many points you want your star to have) pieces. Draw lines
   between these points, making them curve towards the center of the
   star (with `quadraticCurveTo`, you can use the center as control
   point).

!!solution!!

=== The pie chart ===

Earlier in the chapter, we saw an example program that drew a simple
pie chart. Modify this program so that the name of each category is
shown next to the slice that represents it. Try to find a way to
automatically position this text that looks pleasing, and would work
for other data sets as well. You may assume that categories are no
smaller than 5% (i.e. there won't be a bunch of tiny ones next to each
other).

You might again need `Math.sin` and `Math.cos`, as described in the
previous exercise.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas width="600" height="300"></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  var total = results.reduce(function(sum, choice) {
    return sum + choice.count;
  }, 0);

  var currentAngle = -0.5 * Math.PI;
  var centerX = 300, centerY = 150;
  // Add code to draw the slice labels in this loop.
  results.forEach(function(result) {
    var sliceAngle = (result.count / total) * 2 * Math.PI;
    cx.beginPath();
    cx.arc(centerX, centerY, 100,
           currentAngle, currentAngle + sliceAngle);
    currentAngle += sliceAngle;
    cx.lineTo(centerX, centerY);
    cx.fillStyle = result.color;
    cx.fill();
  });
</script>
----

!!solution!!

You will need to call `drawText`, and set the context's `textAlign`
and `textBaseline` properties in such a way that the text ends up where
you want it.

A sensible way to position the labels would be to put the text on the
line going from the center of the pie through the middle of the slice.
You don't want to put the text directly against the side of the pie,
but rather move it outside of it a given amount of pixels.

The angle of this line is `currentAngle + 0.5 * sliceAngle`. The code
below finds a position on this line, 120 pixels from the center:

// test: no

[source,javascript]
----
var middleAngle = currentAngle + 0.5 * sliceAngle;
var textX = Math.cos(middleAngle) * 120 + centerX;
var textY = Math.sin(middleAngle) * 120 + centerY;
----

For `textBaseline`, the value `"middle"` is probably appropriate when
using this approach. What to use for `textAlign` depends on the side
of the circle we are on—on the left, it should be `"right"`, and on
the right, it should be `"left"`, so that the text is positioned away
from the pie.

If you are not sure how to find out which side of the circle a given
angle is on, look back to the explanation of `Math.cos` in the
previous exercise. The cosine of an angle tells us which x coordinate
it corresponds to, which in turn tells us exactly which side of the
circle we are on.

!!solution!!

=== A bouncing ball ===

Use the `requestAnimationFrame` technique that we saw in Chapter 14
and Chapter 15 to draw a box with a bouncing ball inside of it. The
ball moves at a constant speed, and bounces off the box's sides when
it hits them.

ifdef::html_target[]

// test: no

[source,text/html]
----
<canvas width="400" height="400"></canvas>
<script>
  var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");

  var lastTime = null;
  function frame(time) {
    if (lastTime != null)
      updateAnimation(Math.min(100, time - lastTime) / 1000);
    lastTime = time;
    requestAnimationFrame(frame);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);

  function updateAnimation(step) {
    // Your code here.
  }
</script>
----

!!solution!!

A box is easy to draw with `strokeRect`. Define a variable that holds
its size (or two variables, if your box's width and height differ). To
create a round ball, start a path, call ++arc(x, y, radius, 0, 7)++—an
arc going from zero to more than a whole circle—and fill it.

To model the ball's position and speed, you can use the `Vector` type
from Chapter 15!!html  (which is available on this page)!!. Give it a
starting speed, preferably one that is not purely vertical or
horizontal, and every frame, multiply that speed with the amount of
time that elapsed. When the ball gets too close to a vertical wall,
invert the x component in its speed. Likewise, invert the y component
when it hits a horizontal wall.

After finding the ball's new position and speed, use `clearRect` to
delete the scene, and redraw it using the new position.

!!solution!!

=== Precomputed mirroring ===

One unfortunate thing about transformations is that they slow down
drawing of bitmaps. For vector graphics, the effect is less serious,
since there only a few points (for example the center of a circle)
need to be transformed, and then drawing continues as normal. For a
bitmap image, the position of each pixel has to be transformed, and
though it is possible that browsers will get more clever about this in
the future, this currently causes a measurable increase in the time it
takes to draw a bitmap.

In a game like ours, where we are only drawing a single transformed
sprite, this is a non-issue. But imagine that we need to draw hundreds
of characters, or thousands of rotating particles from an explosion.

Think of a way to allow us to draw an inverted character, without
drawing and loading additional image files, and without having to make
transformed `drawImage` calls every frame.

!!solution!!

The key to the solution is the fact that we can use a canvas element
as a source image when using `drawImage`. It is possible to create an
extra `<canvas>` element, without adding it to the document, and draw
our inverted sprites to it, once. When drawing an actual frame, we
just copy the already inverted sprites to the main canvas.

Some care would be required because images do not load instantly. We
only do the inverted drawing once, and if we do it before the image
loads, it won't draw anything. A `"load"` handler on the image can be
used to draw the inverted images to the extra canvas. This canvas can
be used as a drawing source immediately (it'll simply be blank until
we draw the character onto it).

!!solution!!
